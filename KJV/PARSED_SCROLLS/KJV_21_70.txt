Job 33:20	So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
Job 33:21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones [that] were not seen stick out.
Job 33:22	Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
Job 33:23	If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
Job 33:24	Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
Job 33:25	His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
Job 33:26	He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
Job 33:27	He looketh upon men, and [if any] say, I have sinned, and perverted [that which was] right, and it profited me not;
Job 33:28	He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
Job 33:29	Lo, all these [things] worketh God oftentimes with man,
Job 33:30	To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
Job 33:31	Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
Job 33:32	If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
Job 33:33	If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
Job 34:1	Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
Job 34:2	Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
Job 34:3	For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
Job 34:4	Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.
Job 34:5	For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
Job 34:6	Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.
Job 34:7	What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?
Job 34:8	Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
Job 34:9	For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
Job 34:10	Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.
Job 34:11	For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.
Job 34:12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
Job 34:13	Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
Job 34:14	If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
Job 34:15	All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
Job 34:16	If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
Job 34:17	Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
Job 34:18	[Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?
Job 34:19	[How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.
Job 34:20	In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
Job 34:21	For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
Job 34:22	[There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
Job 34:23	For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.
Job 34:24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
Job 34:25	Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.
Job 34:26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
Job 34:27	Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
Job 34:28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
Job 34:29	When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:
Job 34:30	That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
Job 34:31	Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:
Job 34:32	[That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
Job 34:33	[Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
Job 34:34	Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
Job 34:35	Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.
Job 34:36	My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.
Job 34:37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
Job 35:1	Elihu spake moreover, and said,
Job 35:2	Thinkest thou this to be right, [that] thou saidst, My righteousness [is] more than God’s?
Job 35:3	For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? [and], What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin?
Job 35:4	I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
Job 35:5	Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than thou.
Job 35:6	If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
Job 35:7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
Job 35:8	Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou [art]; and thy righteousness [may profit] the son of man.
Job 35:9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
Job 35:10	But none saith, Where [is] God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
Job 35:11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
Job 35:12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
Job 35:13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
Job 35:14	Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust thou in him.
Job 35:15	But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth [it] not in great extremity:
Job 35:16	Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
Job 36:1	Elihu also proceeded, and said,
Job 36:2	Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that [I have] yet to speak on God’s behalf.
Job 36:3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
