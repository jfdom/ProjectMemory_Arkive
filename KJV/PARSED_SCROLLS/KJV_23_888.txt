Psalm 77:9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
Psalm 77:10	And I said, This [is] my infirmity: [but I will remember] the years of the right hand of the most High.
Psalm 77:11	I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psalm 77:12	I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Psalm 77:13	Thy way, O God, [is] in the sanctuary: who [is so] great a God as [our] God?
Psalm 77:14	Thou [art] the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
Psalm 77:15	Thou hast with [thine] arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
Psalm 77:16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
Psalm 77:17	The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
Psalm 77:18	The voice of thy thunder [was] in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
Psalm 77:19	Thy way [is] in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Psalm 77:20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalm 78:1	Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, [to] my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalm 78:2	I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
Psalm 78:3	Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
Psalm 78:4	We will not hide [them] from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
Psalm 78:5	For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
Psalm 78:6	That the generation to come might know [them, even] the children [which] should be born; [who] should arise and declare [them] to their children:
Psalm 78:7	That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
Psalm 78:8	And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation [that] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psalm 78:9	The children of Ephraim, [being] armed, [and] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
Psalm 78:10	They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
Psalm 78:11	And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
Psalm 78:12	Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.
Psalm 78:13	He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
Psalm 78:14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
Psalm 78:15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as [out of] the great depths.
Psalm 78:16	He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalm 78:17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
Psalm 78:18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
Psalm 78:19	Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
Psalm 78:20	Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
Psalm 78:21	Therefore the LORD heard [this], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
Psalm 78:22	Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
Psalm 78:23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
Psalm 78:24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
Psalm 78:25	Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
Psalm 78:26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
Psalm 78:27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
Psalm 78:28	And he let [it] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
Psalm 78:29	So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
Psalm 78:30	They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat [was] yet in their mouths,
Psalm 78:31	The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen [men] of Israel.
Psalm 78:32	For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
Psalm 78:33	Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
Psalm 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
Psalm 78:35	And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
Psalm 78:36	Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
Psalm 78:37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
Psalm 78:38	But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalm 78:39	For he remembered that they [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalm 78:40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] grieve him in the desert!
Psalm 78:41	Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
Psalm 78:42	They remembered not his hand, [nor] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
Psalm 78:43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
Psalm 78:44	And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
Psalm 78:45	He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalm 78:46	He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
Psalm 78:47	He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
Psalm 78:48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalm 78:49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels [among them].
Psalm 78:50	He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
Psalm 78:51	And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of [their] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
Psalm 78:52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalm 78:53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalm 78:54	And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [even to] this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.
Psalm 78:55	He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalm 78:56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
Psalm 78:57	But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalm 78:58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalm 78:59	When God heard [this], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
Psalm 78:60	So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] he placed among men;
Psalm 78:61	And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
Psalm 78:62	He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
Psalm 78:63	The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
Psalm 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
Psalm 78:65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
Psalm 78:66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
Psalm 78:67	Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
Psalm 78:68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
Psalm 78:69	And he built his sanctuary like high [palaces], like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalm 78:70	He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalm 78:71	From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalm 78:72	So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
Psalm 79:1	A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
Psalm 79:2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given [to be] meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
Psalm 79:3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and [there was] none to bury [them].
Psalm 79:4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalm 79:5	How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalm 79:6	Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
Psalm 79:7	For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
Psalm 79:8	O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
Psalm 79:9	Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.
Psalm 79:10	Wherefore should the heathen say, Where [is] their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight [by] the revenging of the blood of thy servants [which is] shed.
Psalm 79:11	Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
Psalm 79:12	And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
Psalm 79:13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
Psalm 80:1	To the chief Musician upon ShoshannimEduth, A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest [between] the cherubims, shine forth.

Psalm 80:8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
Psalm 80:9	Thou preparedst [room] before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
Psalm 80:10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof [were like] the goodly cedars.
Psalm 80:11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
Psalm 80:12	Why hast thou [then] broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
Psalm 80:13	The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Psalm 80:14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
Psalm 80:15	And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch [that] thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalm 80:16	[It is] burned with fire, [it is] cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
Psalm 80:17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man [whom] thou madest strong for thyself.
Psalm 80:18	So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
Psalm 80:19	Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.

Psalm 81:6	I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.

Psalm 81:10	I [am] the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
Psalm 81:11	But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
Psalm 81:12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: [and] they walked in their own counsels.
Psalm 81:13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, [and] Israel had walked in my ways!
Psalm 81:14	I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
Psalm 81:15	The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
