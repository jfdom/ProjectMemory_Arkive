Ecclesiastes 3:3	A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
Ecclesiastes 3:4	A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
Ecclesiastes 3:5	A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
Ecclesiastes 3:6	A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
Ecclesiastes 3:7	A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
Ecclesiastes 3:8	A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
Ecclesiastes 3:9	What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?
Ecclesiastes 3:10	I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.
Ecclesiastes 3:11	He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.
Ecclesiastes 3:12	I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.
Ecclesiastes 3:13	And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes 3:14	I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.
Ecclesiastes 3:15	That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.
Ecclesiastes 3:16	And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.
Ecclesiastes 3:17	I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.
Ecclesiastes 3:18	I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
Ecclesiastes 3:19	For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 3:20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
Ecclesiastes 3:21	Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?
Ecclesiastes 3:22	Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
Ecclesiastes 4:1	So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.
Ecclesiastes 4:2	Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.
Ecclesiastes 4:3	Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 4:4	Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.
Ecclesiastes 4:5	The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.
Ecclesiastes 4:6	Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.
Ecclesiastes 4:7	Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 4:8	There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail.
Ecclesiastes 4:9	Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.
Ecclesiastes 4:10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] not another to help him up.
Ecclesiastes 4:11	Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?
Ecclesiastes 4:12	And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
Ecclesiastes 4:13	Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.
Ecclesiastes 4:14	For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becometh poor.
Ecclesiastes 4:15	I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.
Ecclesiastes 4:16	[There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.
Ecclesiastes 5:1	Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.
Ecclesiastes 5:2	Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God: for God [is] in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.
Ecclesiastes 5:3	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice [is known] by multitude of words.
Ecclesiastes 5:4	When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.
Ecclesiastes 5:5	Better [is it] that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
Ecclesiastes 5:6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it [was] an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?
Ecclesiastes 5:7	For in the multitude of dreams and many words [there are] also [divers] vanities: but fear thou God.
Ecclesiastes 5:8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for [he that is] higher than the highest regardeth; and [there be] higher than they.
Ecclesiastes 5:9	Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king [himself] is served by the field.
Ecclesiastes 5:10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this [is] also vanity.
Ecclesiastes 5:11	When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, saving the beholding [of them] with their eyes?
Ecclesiastes 5:12	The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
Ecclesiastes 5:13	There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
Ecclesiastes 5:14	But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in his hand.
Ecclesiastes 5:15	As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
Ecclesiastes 5:16	And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?
Ecclesiastes 5:17	All his days also he eateth in darkness, and [he hath] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
Ecclesiastes 5:18	Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and comely [for one] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it [is] his portion.
Ecclesiastes 5:19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.
Ecclesiastes 5:20	For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth [him] in the joy of his heart.
Ecclesiastes 6:1	There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it [is] common among men:
Ecclesiastes 6:2	A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this [is] vanity, and it [is] an evil disease.
Ecclesiastes 6:3	If a man beget an hundred [children], and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also [that] he have no burial; I say, [that] an untimely birth [is] better than he.
Ecclesiastes 6:4	For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
Ecclesiastes 6:5	Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known [any thing]: this hath more rest than the other.
Ecclesiastes 6:6	Yea, though he live a thousand years twice [told], yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?
Ecclesiastes 6:7	All the labour of man [is] for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.
Ecclesiastes 6:8	For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?
Ecclesiastes 6:9	Better [is] the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.
Ecclesiastes 6:10	That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it [is] man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
Ecclesiastes 6:11	Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what [is] man the better?
Ecclesiastes 6:12	For who knoweth what [is] good for man in [this] life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
Ecclesiastes 7:1	A good name [is] better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
Ecclesiastes 7:2	[It is] better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that [is] the end of all men; and the living will lay [it] to his heart.
