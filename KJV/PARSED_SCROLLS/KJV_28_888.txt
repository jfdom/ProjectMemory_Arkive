Ecclesiastes 7:3	Sorrow [is] better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
Ecclesiastes 7:4	The heart of the wise [is] in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools [is] in the house of mirth.
Ecclesiastes 7:5	[It is] better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
Ecclesiastes 7:6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so [is] the laughter of the fool: this also [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 7:7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
Ecclesiastes 7:8	Better [is] the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: [and] the patient in spirit [is] better than the proud in spirit.
Ecclesiastes 7:9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
Ecclesiastes 7:10	Say not thou, What is [the cause] that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
Ecclesiastes 7:11	Wisdom [is] good with an inheritance: and [by it there is] profit to them that see the sun.
Ecclesiastes 7:12	For wisdom [is] a defence, [and] money [is] a defence: but the excellency of knowledge [is, that] wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
Ecclesiastes 7:13	Consider the work of God: for who can make [that] straight, which he hath made crooked?
Ecclesiastes 7:14	In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
Ecclesiastes 7:15	All [things] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just [man] that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his life] in his wickedness.
Ecclesiastes 7:16	Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
Ecclesiastes 7:17	Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
Ecclesiastes 7:18	[It is] good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
Ecclesiastes 7:19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] which are in the city.
Ecclesiastes 7:20	For [there is] not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
Ecclesiastes 7:21	Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
Ecclesiastes 7:22	For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
Ecclesiastes 7:23	All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it [was] far from me.
Ecclesiastes 7:24	That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
Ecclesiastes 7:25	I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason [of things], and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness [and] madness:
Ecclesiastes 7:26	And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart [is] snares and nets, [and] her hands [as] bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
Ecclesiastes 7:27	Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, [counting] one by one, to find out the account:
Ecclesiastes 7:28	Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
Ecclesiastes 7:29	Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
Ecclesiastes 8:1	Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
Ecclesiastes 8:2	I [counsel thee] to keep the king’s commandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God.
Ecclesiastes 8:3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.
Ecclesiastes 8:4	Where the word of a king [is, there is] power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
Ecclesiastes 8:5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerneth both time and judgment.
Ecclesiastes 8:6	Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man [is] great upon him.
Ecclesiastes 8:7	For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?
Ecclesiastes 8:8	[There is] no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [hath he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
Ecclesiastes 8:9	All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.
Ecclesiastes 8:10	And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity.
Ecclesiastes 8:11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Ecclesiastes 8:12	Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his [days] be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:
Ecclesiastes 8:13	But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
Ecclesiastes 8:14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just [men], unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked [men], to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 8:15	Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 8:16	When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also [there is that] neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)
Ecclesiastes 8:17	Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find [it]; yea further; though a wise [man] think to know [it], yet shall he not be able to find [it].
Ecclesiastes 9:1	For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, [are] in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred [by] all [that is] before them.
Ecclesiastes 9:2	All [things come] alike to all: [there is] one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as [is] the good, so [is] the sinner; [and] he that sweareth, as [he] that feareth an oath.
Ecclesiastes 9:3	This [is] an evil among all [things] that are done under the sun, that [there is] one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness [is] in their heart while they live, and after that [they go] to the dead.
Ecclesiastes 9:4	For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
Ecclesiastes 9:5	For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.
Ecclesiastes 9:6	Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any [thing] that is done under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9:7	Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
Ecclesiastes 9:8	Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
Ecclesiastes 9:9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that [is] thy portion in [this] life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.
Ecclesiastes 9:10	Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do [it] with thy might; for [there is] no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
Ecclesiastes 9:11	I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race [is] not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
Ecclesiastes 9:12	For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so [are] the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
Ecclesiastes 9:13	This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it [seemed] great unto me:
Ecclesiastes 9:14	[There was] a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it:
Ecclesiastes 9:15	Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
Ecclesiastes 9:16	Then said I, Wisdom [is] better than strength: nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom [is] despised, and his words are not heard.
Ecclesiastes 9:17	The words of wise [men are] heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
Ecclesiastes 9:18	Wisdom [is] better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.
Ecclesiastes 10:1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: [so doth] a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom [and] honour.
Ecclesiastes 10:2	A wise man’s heart [is] at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.
Ecclesiastes 10:3	Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth [him], and he saith to every one [that] he [is] a fool.
Ecclesiastes 10:4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.
Ecclesiastes 10:5	There is an evil [which] I have seen under the sun, as an error [which] proceedeth from the ruler:
Ecclesiastes 10:6	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
Ecclesiastes 10:7	I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes 10:8	He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
Ecclesiastes 10:9	Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; [and] he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
Ecclesiastes 10:10	If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom [is] profitable to direct.
Ecclesiastes 10:11	Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
Ecclesiastes 10:12	The words of a wise man’s mouth [are] gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
Ecclesiastes 10:13	The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness: and the end of his talk [is] mischievous madness.
Ecclesiastes 10:14	A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
Ecclesiastes 10:15	The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
Ecclesiastes 10:16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
Ecclesiastes 10:17	Blessed [art] thou, O land, when thy king [is] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
Ecclesiastes 10:18	By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
Ecclesiastes 10:19	A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all [things].
Ecclesiastes 10:20	Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
Ecclesiastes 11:1	Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.
Ecclesiastes 11:2	Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
Ecclesiastes 11:3	If the clouds be full of rain, they empty [themselves] upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
Ecclesiastes 11:4	He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
Ecclesiastes 11:5	As thou knowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, [nor] how the bones [do grow] in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
Ecclesiastes 11:6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both [shall be] alike good.
Ecclesiastes 11:7	Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] for the eyes to behold the sun:
Ecclesiastes 11:8	But if a man live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 11:9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these [things] God will bring thee into judgment.
Ecclesiastes 11:10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth [are] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 12:1	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
Ecclesiastes 12:2	While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:
Ecclesiastes 12:3	In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,
Ecclesiastes 12:4	And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;
Ecclesiastes 12:5	Also [when] they shall be afraid of [that which is] high, and fears [shall be] in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:
Ecclesiastes 12:6	Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.
Ecclesiastes 12:7	Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
Ecclesiastes 12:8	Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all [is] vanity.
Ecclesiastes 12:9	And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, [and] set in order many proverbs.
Ecclesiastes 12:10	The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and [that which was] written [was] upright, [even] words of truth.
Ecclesiastes 12:11	The words of the wise [are] as goads, and as nails fastened [by] the masters of assemblies, [which] are given from one shepherd.
Ecclesiastes 12:12	And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books [there is] no end; and much study [is] a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes 12:13	Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this [is] the whole [duty] of man.
Ecclesiastes 12:14	For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil.
Song of Solomon 1:1	The song of songs, which [is] Solomon’s.
Song of Solomon 1:2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love [is] better than wine.
Song of Solomon 1:3	Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name [is as] ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
Song of Solomon 1:4	Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
Song of Solomon 1:5	I [am] black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
Song of Solomon 1:6	Look not upon me, because I [am] black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; [but] mine own vineyard have I not kept.
Song of Solomon 1:7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest [thy flock] to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
Song of Solomon 1:8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.
Song of Solomon 1:9	I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.
Song of Solomon 1:10	Thy cheeks are comely with rows [of jewels], thy neck with chains [of gold].
Song of Solomon 1:11	We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
Song of Solomon 1:12	While the king [sitteth] at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
Song of Solomon 1:13	A bundle of myrrh [is] my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
Song of Solomon 1:14	My beloved [is] unto me [as] a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi.
Song of Solomon 1:15	Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves’ eyes.
Song of Solomon 1:16	Behold, thou [art] fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed [is] green.
Song of Solomon 1:17	The beams of our house [are] cedar, [and] our rafters of fir.
Song of Solomon 2:1	I [am] the rose of Sharon, [and] the lily of the valleys.
Song of Solomon 2:2	As the lily among thorns, so [is] my love among the daughters.
Song of Solomon 2:3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so [is] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.
Song of Solomon 2:4	He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me [was] love.
Song of Solomon 2:5	Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I [am] sick of love.
Song of Solomon 2:6	His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
Song of Solomon 2:7	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.
Song of Solomon 2:8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
Song of Solomon 2:9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
Song of Solomon 2:10	My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
Song of Solomon 2:11	For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over [and] gone;
Song of Solomon 2:12	The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
Song of Solomon 2:13	The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines [with] the tender grape give a [good] smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
Song of Solomon 2:14	O my dove, [that art] in the clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] comely.
Song of Solomon 2:15	Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines [have] tender grapes.
Song of Solomon 2:16	My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his: he feedeth among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 2:17	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
Song of Solomon 3:1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
Song of Solomon 3:2	I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.
Song of Solomon 3:3	The watchmen that go about the city found me: [to whom I said], Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
Song of Solomon 3:4	[It was] but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.
Song of Solomon 3:5	I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.
Song of Solomon 3:6	Who [is] this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
Song of Solomon 3:7	Behold his bed, which [is] Solomon’s; threescore valiant men [are] about it, of the valiant of Israel.
Song of Solomon 3:8	They all hold swords, [being] expert in war: every man [hath] his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.
Song of Solomon 3:9	King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon 3:10	He made the pillars thereof [of] silver, the bottom thereof [of] gold, the covering of it [of] purple, the midst thereof being paved [with] love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Solomon 3:11	Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
Song of Solomon 4:1	Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
Song of Solomon 4:2	Thy teeth [are] like a flock [of sheep that are even] shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none [is] barren among them.
Song of Solomon 4:3	Thy lips [are] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech [is] comely: thy temples [are] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
Song of Solomon 4:4	Thy neck [is] like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
Song of Solomon 4:5	Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 4:6	Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
Song of Solomon 4:7	Thou [art] all fair, my love; [there is] no spot in thee.
Song of Solomon 4:8	Come with me from Lebanon, [my] spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
Song of Solomon 4:9	Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
Song of Solomon 4:10	How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
Song of Solomon 4:11	Thy lips, O [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb: honey and milk [are] under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.
Song of Solomon 4:12	A garden inclosed [is] my sister, [my] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
Song of Solomon 4:13	Thy plants [are] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
Song of Solomon 4:14	Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
Song of Solomon 4:15	A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
Song of Solomon 4:16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
Song of Solomon 5:1	I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
Song of Solomon 5:2	I sleep, but my heart waketh: [it is] the voice of my beloved that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, [and] my locks with the drops of the night.
Song of Solomon 5:3	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
Song of Solomon 5:4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], and my bowels were moved for him.
Song of Solomon 5:5	I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped [with] myrrh, and my fingers [with] sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
Song of Solomon 5:6	I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
Song of Solomon 5:7	The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
Song of Solomon 5:8	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I [am] sick of love.
Song of Solomon 5:9	What [is] thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? what [is] thy beloved more than [another] beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
Song of Solomon 5:10	My beloved [is] white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
Song of Solomon 5:11	His head [is as] the most fine gold, his locks [are] bushy, [and] black as a raven.
Song of Solomon 5:12	His eyes [are] as [the eyes] of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, [and] fitly set.
Song of Solomon 5:13	His cheeks [are] as a bed of spices, [as] sweet flowers: his lips [like] lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
Song of Solomon 5:14	His hands [are as] gold rings set with the beryl: his belly [is as] bright ivory overlaid [with] sapphires.
Song of Solomon 5:15	His legs [are as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance [is] as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
Song of Solomon 5:16	His mouth [is] most sweet: yea, he [is] altogether lovely. This [is] my beloved, and this [is] my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Solomon 6:1	Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
Song of Solomon 6:2	My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
Song of Solomon 6:3	I [am] my beloved’s, and my beloved [is] mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
Song of Solomon 6:4	Thou [art] beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as [an army] with banners.
Song of Solomon 6:5	Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
Song of Solomon 6:6	Thy teeth [are] as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and [there is] not one barren among them.
Song of Solomon 6:7	As a piece of a pomegranate [are] thy temples within thy locks.
Song of Solomon 6:8	There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
Song of Solomon 6:9	My dove, my undefiled is [but] one; she [is] the [only] one of her mother, she [is] the choice [one] of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; [yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
Song of Solomon 6:10	Who [is] she [that] looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, [and] terrible as [an army] with banners?
Song of Solomon 6:11	I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, [and] to see whether the vine flourished, [and] the pomegranates budded.

Isaiah 8:5	The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,
Isaiah 8:6	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;
Isaiah 8:7	Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:
