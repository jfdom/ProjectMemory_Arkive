1 Corinthians 4:5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
1 Corinthians 4:6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and [to] Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think [of men] above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
1 Corinthians 4:7	For who maketh thee to differ [from another]? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive [it], why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received [it]?
1 Corinthians 4:8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1 Corinthians 4:9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
1 Corinthians 4:10	We [are] fools for Christ’s sake, but ye [are] wise in Christ; we [are] weak, but ye [are] strong; ye [are] honourable, but we [are] despised.
1 Corinthians 4:11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;
1 Corinthians 4:12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:
1 Corinthians 4:13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, [and are] the offscouring of all things unto this day.
1 Corinthians 4:14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn [you].
1 Corinthians 4:15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet [have ye] not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
1 Corinthians 4:16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.
1 Corinthians 4:17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
1 Corinthians 4:18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.
1 Corinthians 4:19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.
1 Corinthians 4:20	For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.
1 Corinthians 4:21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and [in] the spirit of meekness?
1 Corinthians 5:1	It is reported commonly [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
1 Corinthians 5:2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1 Corinthians 5:3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, [concerning] him that hath so done this deed,
1 Corinthians 5:4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Corinthians 5:5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1 Corinthians 5:6	Your glorying [is] not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
1 Corinthians 5:7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
1 Corinthians 5:8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.
1 Corinthians 5:9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
1 Corinthians 5:10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
1 Corinthians 5:11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
1 Corinthians 5:12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
1 Corinthians 5:13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1 Corinthians 6:1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
1 Corinthians 6:2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1 Corinthians 6:3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
1 Corinthians 6:4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
1 Corinthians 6:5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
1 Corinthians 6:6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
1 Corinthians 6:7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather [suffer yourselves to] be defrauded?
1 Corinthians 6:8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that [your] brethren.
1 Corinthians 6:9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
1 Corinthians 6:10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1 Corinthians 6:11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
1 Corinthians 6:12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1 Corinthians 6:13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
1 Corinthians 6:14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
1 Corinthians 6:15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make [them] the members of an harlot? God forbid.
1 Corinthians 6:16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
1 Corinthians 6:17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1 Corinthians 6:18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
1 Corinthians 6:19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
1 Corinthians 6:20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.
1 Corinthians 7:1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman.
1 Corinthians 7:2	Nevertheless, [to avoid] fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
1 Corinthians 7:3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1 Corinthians 7:4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.
1 Corinthians 7:5	Defraud ye not one the other, except [it be] with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.
1 Corinthians 7:6	But I speak this by permission, [and] not of commandment.
1 Corinthians 7:7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
1 Corinthians 7:8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1 Corinthians 7:9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
1 Corinthians 7:10	And unto the married I command, [yet] not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from [her] husband:
1 Corinthians 7:11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to [her] husband: and let not the husband put away [his] wife.
1 Corinthians 7:12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
1 Corinthians 7:13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
1 Corinthians 7:14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
1 Corinthians 7:15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such [cases]: but God hath called us to peace.
1 Corinthians 7:16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save [thy] husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save [thy] wife?
1 Corinthians 7:17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.
1 Corinthians 7:18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
1 Corinthians 7:19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1 Corinthians 7:20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
1 Corinthians 7:21	Art thou called [being] a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use [it] rather.
1 Corinthians 7:22	For he that is called in the Lord, [being] a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, [being] free, is Christ’s servant.
1 Corinthians 7:23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.
1 Corinthians 7:24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
1 Corinthians 7:25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
1 Corinthians 7:26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, [I say], that [it is] good for a man so to be.
1 Corinthians 7:27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
1 Corinthians 7:28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.
1 Corinthians 7:29	But this I say, brethren, the time [is] short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;
1 Corinthians 7:30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;
1 Corinthians 7:31	And they that use this world, as not abusing [it]: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
1 Corinthians 7:32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:
1 Corinthians 7:33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please [his] wife.
1 Corinthians 7:34	There is difference [also] between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please [her] husband.
1 Corinthians 7:35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.
1 Corinthians 7:36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of [her] age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.
1 Corinthians 7:37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.
1 Corinthians 7:38	So then he that giveth [her] in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth [her] not in marriage doeth better.
1 Corinthians 7:39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 7:40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
1 Corinthians 8:1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.
1 Corinthians 8:2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.
1 Corinthians 8:3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.
1 Corinthians 8:4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol [is] nothing in the world, and that [there is] none other God but one.
1 Corinthians 8:5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)
1 Corinthians 8:6	But to us [there is but] one God, the Father, of whom [are] all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom [are] all things, and we by him.
1 Corinthians 8:7	Howbeit [there is] not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat [it] as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1 Corinthians 8:8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.
1 Corinthians 8:9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
1 Corinthians 8:10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;
1 Corinthians 8:11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
1 Corinthians 8:12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
1 Corinthians 8:13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
1 Corinthians 9:1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
1 Corinthians 9:2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 9:3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,
1 Corinthians 9:4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?
1 Corinthians 9:5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and [as] the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?
1 Corinthians 9:6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?
1 Corinthians 9:7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?
1 Corinthians 9:8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
1 Corinthians 9:9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?
1 Corinthians 9:10	Or saith he [it] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, [this] is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.
1 Corinthians 9:11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, [is it] a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?
1 Corinthians 9:12	If others be partakers of [this] power over you, [are] not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
1 Corinthians 9:13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live [of the things] of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?
1 Corinthians 9:14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1 Corinthians 9:15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for [it were] better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.
1 Corinthians 9:16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!
1 Corinthians 9:17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation [of the gospel] is committed unto me.
1 Corinthians 9:18	What is my reward then? [Verily] that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.
1 Corinthians 9:19	For though I be free from all [men], yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
1 Corinthians 9:20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;
1 Corinthians 9:21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.
1 Corinthians 9:22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.
1 Corinthians 9:23	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with [you].
1 Corinthians 9:24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
1 Corinthians 9:25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they [do it] to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
1 Corinthians 9:26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:
1 Corinthians 9:27	But I keep under my body, and bring [it] into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.
1 Corinthians 10:1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
1 Corinthians 10:2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;
1 Corinthians 10:3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;
1 Corinthians 10:4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
1 Corinthians 10:5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1 Corinthians 10:6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
1 Corinthians 10:7	Neither be ye idolaters, as [were] some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
1 Corinthians 10:8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1 Corinthians 10:9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.
1 Corinthians 10:10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.
1 Corinthians 10:11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.
1 Corinthians 10:12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
1 Corinthians 10:13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God [is] faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear [it].
1 Corinthians 10:14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
1 Corinthians 10:15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1 Corinthians 10:16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
1 Corinthians 10:17	For we [being] many are one bread, [and] one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.
1 Corinthians 10:18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
1 Corinthians 10:19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?
1 Corinthians 10:20	But [I say], that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.
1 Corinthians 10:21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.
1 Corinthians 10:22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1 Corinthians 10:23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.
1 Corinthians 10:24	Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s [wealth].
1 Corinthians 10:25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, [that] eat, asking no question for conscience sake:
1 Corinthians 10:26	For the earth [is] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.
1 Corinthians 10:27	If any of them that believe not bid you [to a feast], and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.
1 Corinthians 10:28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth [is] the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:
1 Corinthians 10:29	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another [man’s] conscience?
1 Corinthians 10:30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1 Corinthians 10:31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
1 Corinthians 10:32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:
1 Corinthians 10:33	Even as I please all [men] in all [things], not seeking mine own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.
1 Corinthians 11:1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.
1 Corinthians 11:2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.
1 Corinthians 11:3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.
1 Corinthians 11:4	Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.
1 Corinthians 11:5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
1 Corinthians 11:6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
1 Corinthians 11:7	For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
1 Corinthians 11:8	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
1 Corinthians 11:9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
1 Corinthians 11:10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.
1 Corinthians 11:11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 11:12	For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
1 Corinthians 11:13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
1 Corinthians 11:14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
1 Corinthians 11:15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.
1 Corinthians 11:16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
1 Corinthians 11:17	Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
1 Corinthians 11:18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
1 Corinthians 11:19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
1 Corinthians 11:20	When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord’s supper.
1 Corinthians 11:21	For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1 Corinthians 11:22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.
1 Corinthians 11:23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:
1 Corinthians 11:24	And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians 11:25	After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.
1 Corinthians 11:26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.
1 Corinthians 11:27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 11:28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.
1 Corinthians 11:29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
1 Corinthians 11:30	For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
1 Corinthians 11:31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
1 Corinthians 11:32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
1 Corinthians 11:33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
1 Corinthians 11:34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
1 Corinthians 12:1	Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
1 Corinthians 12:2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
1 Corinthians 12:3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
1 Corinthians 12:4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1 Corinthians 12:5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
1 Corinthians 12:6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
1 Corinthians 12:7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
1 Corinthians 12:8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
1 Corinthians 12:9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
1 Corinthians 12:10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
1 Corinthians 12:11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
1 Corinthians 12:12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.
1 Corinthians 12:13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
1 Corinthians 12:14	For the body is not one member, but many.
1 Corinthians 12:15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1 Corinthians 12:16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
1 Corinthians 12:17	If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?
1 Corinthians 12:18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
1 Corinthians 12:19	And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?
1 Corinthians 12:20	But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.
1 Corinthians 12:21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1 Corinthians 12:22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
1 Corinthians 12:23	And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.
1 Corinthians 12:24	For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:
1 Corinthians 12:25	That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.
1 Corinthians 12:26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
1 Corinthians 12:27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
1 Corinthians 12:28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
1 Corinthians 12:29	[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?
1 Corinthians 12:30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1 Corinthians 12:31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
1 Corinthians 13:1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
1 Corinthians 13:2	And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
1 Corinthians 13:3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
1 Corinthians 13:4	Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
1 Corinthians 13:5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
1 Corinthians 13:6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
1 Corinthians 13:7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
1 Corinthians 13:8	Charity never faileth: but whether [there be] prophecies, they shall fail; whether [there be] tongues, they shall cease; whether [there be] knowledge, it shall vanish away.
1 Corinthians 13:9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1 Corinthians 13:10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
1 Corinthians 13:11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
1 Corinthians 13:12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
1 Corinthians 13:13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these [is] charity.
1 Corinthians 14:1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual [gifts], but rather that ye may prophesy.
1 Corinthians 14:2	For he that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth [him]; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
1 Corinthians 14:3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men [to] edification, and exhortation, and comfort.
1 Corinthians 14:4	He that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
1 Corinthians 14:5	I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater [is] he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
1 Corinthians 14:6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?
1 Corinthians 14:7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?
1 Corinthians 14:8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
1 Corinthians 14:9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
1 Corinthians 14:10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them [is] without signification.
1 Corinthians 14:11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh [shall be] a barbarian unto me.
1 Corinthians 14:12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.
1 Corinthians 14:13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.
1 Corinthians 14:14	For if I pray in an [unknown] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1 Corinthians 14:15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1 Corinthians 14:16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?
1 Corinthians 14:17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1 Corinthians 14:18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:
1 Corinthians 14:19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that [by my voice] I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.
1 Corinthians 14:20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.
1 Corinthians 14:21	In the law it is written, With [men of] other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying [serveth] not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.
1 Corinthians 14:23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
1 Corinthians 14:24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or [one] unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:
1 Corinthians 14:25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on [his] face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.
1 Corinthians 14:26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.
1 Corinthians 14:27	If any man speak in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most [by] three, and [that] by course; and let one interpret.
1 Corinthians 14:28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.
1 Corinthians 14:29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.
1 Corinthians 14:30	If [any thing] be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.
1 Corinthians 14:31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.
1 Corinthians 14:32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1 Corinthians 14:33	For God is not [the author] of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.
1 Corinthians 14:34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but [they are commanded] to be under obedience, as also saith the law.
1 Corinthians 14:35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.
1 Corinthians 14:36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
1 Corinthians 14:37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
1 Corinthians 14:39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
1 Corinthians 14:40	Let all things be done decently and in order.
1 Corinthians 15:1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
1 Corinthians 15:2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1 Corinthians 15:3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
1 Corinthians 15:4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
1 Corinthians 15:5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
1 Corinthians 15:6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
1 Corinthians 15:7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.
1 Corinthians 15:8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.
1 Corinthians 15:9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
1 Corinthians 15:10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which [was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1 Corinthians 15:11	Therefore whether [it were] I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1 Corinthians 15:12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1 Corinthians 15:13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
1 Corinthians 15:14	And if Christ be not risen, then [is] our preaching vain, and your faith [is] also vain.
1 Corinthians 15:15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.
1 Corinthians 15:16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:
1 Corinthians 15:17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins.
1 Corinthians 15:18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1 Corinthians 15:19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
1 Corinthians 15:20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, [and] become the firstfruits of them that slept.
1 Corinthians 15:21	For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.
1 Corinthians 15:22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
1 Corinthians 15:23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.
1 Corinthians 15:24	Then [cometh] the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
1 Corinthians 15:25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.
1 Corinthians 15:26	The last enemy [that] shall be destroyed [is] death.
1 Corinthians 15:27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under [him, it is] manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.
1 Corinthians 15:28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
1 Corinthians 15:29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
1 Corinthians 15:30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
1 Corinthians 15:31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.
1 Corinthians 15:32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.
1 Corinthians 15:33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
1 Corinthians 15:34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak [this] to your shame.
1 Corinthians 15:35	But some [man] will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
1 Corinthians 15:36	[Thou] fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:
1 Corinthians 15:37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other [grain]:
1 Corinthians 15:38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.
1 Corinthians 15:39	All flesh [is] not the same flesh: but [there is] one [kind of] flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, [and] another of birds.
1 Corinthians 15:40	[There are] also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial [is] one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial [is] another.
1 Corinthians 15:41	[There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for [one] star differeth from [another] star in glory.
1 Corinthians 15:42	So also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:
1 Corinthians 15:43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:
1 Corinthians 15:44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1 Corinthians 15:45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [was made] a quickening spirit.
1 Corinthians 15:46	Howbeit that [was] not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.
1 Corinthians 15:47	The first man [is] of the earth, earthy: the second man [is] the Lord from heaven.
1 Corinthians 15:48	As [is] the earthy, such [are] they also that are earthy: and as [is] the heavenly, such [are] they also that are heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1 Corinthians 15:50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
1 Corinthians 15:51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
1 Corinthians 15:52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
1 Corinthians 15:53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality.
1 Corinthians 15:54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1 Corinthians 15:55	O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?
1 Corinthians 15:56	The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law.
1 Corinthians 15:57	But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Corinthians 15:58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
1 Corinthians 16:1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
1 Corinthians 16:2	Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
1 Corinthians 16:3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
1 Corinthians 16:4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
1 Corinthians 16:5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
1 Corinthians 16:6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
1 Corinthians 16:7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
1 Corinthians 16:8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1 Corinthians 16:9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries.
1 Corinthians 16:10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].
1 Corinthians 16:11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
1 Corinthians 16:12	As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
1 Corinthians 16:13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
1 Corinthians 16:14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1 Corinthians 16:15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
1 Corinthians 16:16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.
1 Corinthians 16:17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
1 Corinthians 16:18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
1 Corinthians 16:19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
1 Corinthians 16:20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
1 Corinthians 16:21	The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.
1 Corinthians 16:22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
1 Corinthians 16:23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.
1 Corinthians 16:24	My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
2 Corinthians 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy [our] brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:
2 Corinthians 1:2	Grace [be] to you and peace from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians 1:3	Blessed [be] God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
2 Corinthians 1:4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
2 Corinthians 1:5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.
2 Corinthians 1:6	And whether we be afflicted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, [it is] for your consolation and salvation.
2 Corinthians 1:7	And our hope of you [is] stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so [shall ye be] also of the consolation.
2 Corinthians 1:8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:
2 Corinthians 1:9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:
2 Corinthians 1:10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver [us];
2 Corinthians 1:11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift [bestowed] upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
2 Corinthians 1:12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
2 Corinthians 1:13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;
2 Corinthians 1:14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also [are] ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
2 Corinthians 1:15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;
2 Corinthians 1:16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.
2 Corinthians 1:17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?
2 Corinthians 1:18	But [as] God [is] true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.
2 Corinthians 1:19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, [even] by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.
2 Corinthians 1:20	For all the promises of God in him [are] yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.
2 Corinthians 1:21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, [is] God;
2 Corinthians 1:22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2 Corinthians 1:23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.
2 Corinthians 1:24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.
2 Corinthians 2:1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.
2 Corinthians 2:2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?
2 Corinthians 2:3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.
2 Corinthians 2:4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.
2 Corinthians 2:5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.
2 Corinthians 2:6	Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.
2 Corinthians 2:7	So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.
2 Corinthians 2:8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.
2 Corinthians 2:9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.
2 Corinthians 2:10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;
2 Corinthians 2:11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
2 Corinthians 2:12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,
2 Corinthians 2:13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.
2 Corinthians 2:14	Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
2 Corinthians 2:15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:
2 Corinthians 2:16	To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?
2 Corinthians 2:17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
2 Corinthians 3:1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some [others], epistles of commendation to you, or [letters] of commendation from you?
2 Corinthians 3:2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
2 Corinthians 3:3	[Forasmuch as ye are] manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
2 Corinthians 3:4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
2 Corinthians 3:5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency [is] of God;
2 Corinthians 3:6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
2 Corinthians 3:7	But if the ministration of death, written [and] engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which [glory] was to be done away:
2 Corinthians 3:8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?
2 Corinthians 3:9	For if the ministration of condemnation [be] glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
2 Corinthians 3:10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.
2 Corinthians 3:11	For if that which is done away [was] glorious, much more that which remaineth [is] glorious.
2 Corinthians 3:12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:
2 Corinthians 3:13	And not as Moses, [which] put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:
2 Corinthians 3:14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which [vail] is done away in Christ.
2 Corinthians 3:15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.
2 Corinthians 3:16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.
2 Corinthians 3:17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
2 Corinthians 3:18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 4:1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;
2 Corinthians 4:2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
2 Corinthians 4:3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:
2 Corinthians 4:4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
2 Corinthians 4:5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.
2 Corinthians 4:6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to [give] the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2 Corinthians 4:7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.
2 Corinthians 4:8	[We are] troubled on every side, yet not distressed; [we are] perplexed, but not in despair;
2 Corinthians 4:9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
2 Corinthians 4:10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
2 Corinthians 4:11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
2 Corinthians 4:12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
2 Corinthians 4:13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;
2 Corinthians 4:14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present [us] with you.
2 Corinthians 4:15	For all things [are] for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.
2 Corinthians 4:16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward [man] is renewed day by day.
2 Corinthians 4:17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;
2 Corinthians 4:18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal.
2 Corinthians 5:1	For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2 Corinthians 5:2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:
2 Corinthians 5:3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
2 Corinthians 5:4	For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.
2 Corinthians 5:5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2 Corinthians 5:6	Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:
2 Corinthians 5:7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)
2 Corinthians 5:8	We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.
2 Corinthians 5:9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.
2 Corinthians 5:10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.
2 Corinthians 5:11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
2 Corinthians 5:12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.
2 Corinthians 5:13	For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.
2 Corinthians 5:14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:
2 Corinthians 5:15	And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.
2 Corinthians 5:16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.
2 Corinthians 5:17	Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.
2 Corinthians 5:18	And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;
2 Corinthians 5:19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
2 Corinthians 5:20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.
2 Corinthians 5:21	For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
2 Corinthians 6:1	We then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
2 Corinthians 6:2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)
2 Corinthians 6:3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
2 Corinthians 6:4	But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
2 Corinthians 6:5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;
2 Corinthians 6:6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
2 Corinthians 6:7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2 Corinthians 6:8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;
2 Corinthians 6:9	As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
2 Corinthians 6:10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.
2 Corinthians 6:11	O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
2 Corinthians 6:12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
2 Corinthians 6:13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged.
2 Corinthians 6:14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
2 Corinthians 6:15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
2 Corinthians 6:16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2 Corinthians 6:17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,
2 Corinthians 6:18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
2 Corinthians 7:1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2 Corinthians 7:2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
2 Corinthians 7:3	I speak not [this] to condemn [you]: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with [you].
2 Corinthians 7:4	Great [is] my boldness of speech toward you, great [is] my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
2 Corinthians 7:5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without [were] fightings, within [were] fears.
2 Corinthians 7:6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
2 Corinthians 7:7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.
2 Corinthians 7:8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though [it were] but for a season.
2 Corinthians 7:9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.
2 Corinthians 7:10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.
2 Corinthians 7:11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, [what] clearing of yourselves, yea, [what] indignation, yea, [what] fear, yea, [what] vehement desire, yea, [what] zeal, yea, [what] revenge! In all [things] ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
2 Corinthians 7:12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, [I did it] not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
2 Corinthians 7:13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
2 Corinthians 7:14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which [I made] before Titus, is found a truth.
2 Corinthians 7:15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
2 Corinthians 7:16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all [things].
2 Corinthians 8:1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;
2 Corinthians 8:2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2 Corinthians 8:3	For to [their] power, I bear record, yea, and beyond [their] power [they were] willing of themselves;
2 Corinthians 8:4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and [take upon us] the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
2 Corinthians 8:5	And [this they did], not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.
2 Corinthians 8:6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.
2 Corinthians 8:7	Therefore, as ye abound in every [thing, in] faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and [in] all diligence, and [in] your love to us, [see] that ye abound in this grace also.
2 Corinthians 8:8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.
2 Corinthians 8:9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
2 Corinthians 8:10	And herein I give [my] advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.
2 Corinthians 8:11	Now therefore perform the doing [of it]; that as [there was] a readiness to will, so [there may be] a performance also out of that which ye have.
2 Corinthians 8:12	For if there be first a willing mind, [it is] accepted according to that a man hath, [and] not according to that he hath not.
2 Corinthians 8:13	For [I mean] not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:
2 Corinthians 8:14	But by an equality, [that] now at this time your abundance [may be a supply] for their want, that their abundance also may be [a supply] for your want: that there may be equality:
2 Corinthians 8:15	As it is written, He that [had gathered] much had nothing over; and he that [had gathered] little had no lack.
2 Corinthians 8:16	But thanks [be] to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.
2 Corinthians 8:17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.
2 Corinthians 8:18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise [is] in the gospel throughout all the churches;
2 Corinthians 8:19	And not [that] only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and [declaration of] your ready mind:
2 Corinthians 8:20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:
2 Corinthians 8:21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2 Corinthians 8:22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which [I have] in you.
2 Corinthians 8:23	Whether [any do inquire] of Titus, [he is] my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren [be inquired of, they are] the messengers of the churches, [and] the glory of Christ.
2 Corinthians 8:24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
2 Corinthians 9:1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2 Corinthians 9:2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.
2 Corinthians 9:3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:
2 Corinthians 9:4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
2 Corinthians 9:5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as [a matter of] bounty, and not as [of] covetousness.
2 Corinthians 9:6	But this [I say], He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
2 Corinthians 9:7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
2 Corinthians 9:8	And God [is] able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all [things], may abound to every good work:
2 Corinthians 9:9	(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.
2 Corinthians 9:10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for [your] food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
2 Corinthians 9:11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.
2 Corinthians 9:12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;
2 Corinthians 9:13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for [your] liberal distribution unto them, and unto all [men];
2 Corinthians 9:14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
2 Corinthians 9:15	Thanks [be] unto God for his unspeakable gift.
2 Corinthians 10:1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence [am] base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:
2 Corinthians 10:2	But I beseech [you], that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2 Corinthians 10:3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:
2 Corinthians 10:4	(For the weapons of our warfare [are] not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)
2 Corinthians 10:5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
2 Corinthians 10:6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
2 Corinthians 10:7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he [is] Christ’s, even so [are] we Christ’s.
2 Corinthians 10:8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:
2 Corinthians 10:9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2 Corinthians 10:10	For [his] letters, say they, [are] weighty and powerful; but [his] bodily presence [is] weak, and [his] speech contemptible.
2 Corinthians 10:11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such [will we be] also in deed when we are present.
2 Corinthians 10:12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.
2 Corinthians 10:13	But we will not boast of things without [our] measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
2 Corinthians 10:14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond [our measure], as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in [preaching] the gospel of Christ:
2 Corinthians 10:15	Not boasting of things without [our] measure, [that is], of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,
2 Corinthians 10:16	To preach the gospel in the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.
2 Corinthians 10:17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
2 Corinthians 10:18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.
2 Corinthians 11:1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in [my] folly: and indeed bear with me.
2 Corinthians 11:2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ.
2 Corinthians 11:3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
2 Corinthians 11:4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or [if] ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with [him].
2 Corinthians 11:5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
2 Corinthians 11:6	But though [I be] rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.
2 Corinthians 11:7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
2 Corinthians 11:8	I robbed other churches, taking wages [of them], to do you service.
2 Corinthians 11:9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all [things] I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and [so] will I keep [myself].
2 Corinthians 11:10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.
2 Corinthians 11:11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
2 Corinthians 11:12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
2 Corinthians 11:13	For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.
2 Corinthians 11:14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
2 Corinthians 11:15	Therefore [it is] no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
2 Corinthians 11:16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.
2 Corinthians 11:17	That which I speak, I speak [it] not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.
2 Corinthians 11:18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2 Corinthians 11:19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye [yourselves] are wise.
2 Corinthians 11:20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour [you], if a man take [of you], if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.
2 Corinthians 11:21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.
2 Corinthians 11:22	Are they Hebrews? so [am] I. Are they Israelites? so [am] I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so [am] I.
2 Corinthians 11:23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.
2 Corinthians 11:24	Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one.
2 Corinthians 11:25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;
2 Corinthians 11:26	[In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [mine own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren;
2 Corinthians 11:27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
2 Corinthians 11:28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.
2 Corinthians 11:29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?
2 Corinthians 11:30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.
2 Corinthians 11:31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.
2 Corinthians 11:32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:
2 Corinthians 11:33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.
2 Corinthians 12:1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.
2 Corinthians 12:2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.
2 Corinthians 12:3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)
2 Corinthians 12:4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2 Corinthians 12:5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.
2 Corinthians 12:6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but [now] I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me [to be], or [that] he heareth of me.
2 Corinthians 12:7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
2 Corinthians 12:8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
2 Corinthians 12:9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
2 Corinthians 12:10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2 Corinthians 12:11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.
2 Corinthians 12:12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.
2 Corinthians 12:13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except [it be] that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
2 Corinthians 12:14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2 Corinthians 12:15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.
2 Corinthians 12:16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2 Corinthians 12:17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?
2 Corinthians 12:18	I desired Titus, and with [him] I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? [walked we] not in the same steps?
2 Corinthians 12:19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but [we do] all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
2 Corinthians 12:20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and [that] I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest [there be] debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:
2 Corinthians 12:21	[And] lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and [that] I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
2 Corinthians 13:1	This [is] the third [time] I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2 Corinthians 13:2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:
2 Corinthians 13:3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.
2 Corinthians 13:4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.
2 Corinthians 13:5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?
2 Corinthians 13:6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
2 Corinthians 13:7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.
2 Corinthians 13:8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2 Corinthians 13:9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, [even] your perfection.
2 Corinthians 13:10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
2 Corinthians 13:11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
2 Corinthians 13:12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.
2 Corinthians 13:13	All the saints salute you.
2 Corinthians 13:14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [be] with you all. Amen.
Galatians 1:1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)
Galatians 1:2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:
Galatians 1:3	Grace [be] to you and peace from God the Father, and [from] our Lord Jesus Christ,
Galatians 1:4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:
Galatians 1:5	To whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Galatians 1:6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:
Galatians 1:7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.
Galatians 1:8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:9	As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
Galatians 1:10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.
Galatians 1:11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.
Galatians 1:12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Galatians 1:13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:
Galatians 1:14	And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
Galatians 1:15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called [me] by his grace,
Galatians 1:16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:
Galatians 1:17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.
Galatians 1:18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.
Galatians 1:19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.
Galatians 1:20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.
Galatians 1:21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;
Galatians 1:22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:
Galatians 1:23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.
Galatians 1:24	And they glorified God in me.
Galatians 2:1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with [me] also.
Galatians 2:2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.
Galatians 2:3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:
Galatians 2:4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:
Galatians 2:5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.
Galatians 2:6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man’s person:) for they who seemed [to be somewhat] in conference added nothing to me:
Galatians 2:7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as [the gospel] of the circumcision [was] unto Peter;
Galatians 2:8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)
Galatians 2:9	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we [should go] unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.
Galatians 2:10	Only [they would] that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
Galatians 2:11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.
Galatians 2:12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.
Galatians 2:13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.
Galatians 2:14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
Galatians 2:15	We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
Galatians 2:16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
Galatians 2:17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, [is] therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.
Galatians 2:18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.
Galatians 2:19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
Galatians 2:20	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
Galatians 2:21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness [come] by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
Galatians 3:1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
Galatians 3:2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians 3:3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
Galatians 3:4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if [it be] yet in vain.
Galatians 3:5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?
Galatians 3:6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
Galatians 3:7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.
Galatians 3:8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, [saying], In thee shall all nations be blessed.
Galatians 3:9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
Galatians 3:10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
Galatians 3:11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, [it is] evident: for, The just shall live by faith.
Galatians 3:12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.
Galatians 3:13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed [is] every one that hangeth on a tree:
Galatians 3:14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
Galatians 3:15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though [it be] but a man’s covenant, yet [if it be] confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.
Galatians 3:16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
Galatians 3:17	And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.
Galatians 3:18	For if the inheritance [be] of the law, [it is] no more of promise: but God gave [it] to Abraham by promise.
Galatians 3:19	Wherefore then [serveth] the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; [and it was] ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
Galatians 3:20	Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one, but God is one.
Galatians 3:21	[Is] the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
Galatians 3:22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.
Galatians 3:23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
Galatians 3:24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Galatians 3:25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.
Galatians 3:26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3:27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
Galatians 3:28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3:29	And if ye [be] Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
Galatians 4:1	Now I say, [That] the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;
Galatians 4:2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
Galatians 4:3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:
Galatians 4:4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
Galatians 4:5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
Galatians 4:6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.
Galatians 4:7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
Galatians 4:8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.
Galatians 4:9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?
Galatians 4:10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.
Galatians 4:11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.
Galatians 4:12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I [am]; for I [am] as ye [are]: ye have not injured me at all.
Galatians 4:13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
Galatians 4:14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.
Galatians 4:15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if [it had been] possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.
Galatians 4:16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?
Galatians 4:17	They zealously affect you, [but] not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.
Galatians 4:18	But [it is] good to be zealously affected always in [a] good [thing], and not only when I am present with you.
Galatians 4:19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,
Galatians 4:20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.
Galatians 4:21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?
Galatians 4:22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
Galatians 4:23	But he [who was] of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman [was] by promise.
Galatians 4:24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.
Galatians 4:25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.
Galatians 4:26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.
Galatians 4:27	For it is written, Rejoice, [thou] barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.
Galatians 4:28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
Galatians 4:29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, even so [it is] now.
Galatians 4:30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
Galatians 4:31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
Galatians 5:1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
Galatians 5:2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
Galatians 5:3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
Galatians 5:4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
Galatians 5:5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
Galatians 5:6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
Galatians 5:7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
Galatians 5:8	This persuasion [cometh] not of him that calleth you.
Galatians 5:9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
Galatians 5:10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
Galatians 5:11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
Galatians 5:12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
Galatians 5:13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
Galatians 5:14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Galatians 5:15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
Galatians 5:16	[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
Galatians 5:17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
Galatians 5:18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
Galatians 5:19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
Galatians 5:20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
Galatians 5:21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
Galatians 5:22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
Galatians 5:23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
Galatians 5:24	And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
Galatians 5:25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Galatians 5:26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
Galatians 6:1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
Galatians 6:2	Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
Galatians 6:3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
Galatians 6:4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
Galatians 6:5	For every man shall bear his own burden.
Galatians 6:6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Galatians 6:7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
Galatians 6:8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
Galatians 6:9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
Galatians 6:10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
Galatians 6:11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
Galatians 6:12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
Galatians 6:13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
Galatians 6:14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
Galatians 6:15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
Galatians 6:16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
Galatians 6:17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
Galatians 6:18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.
Ephesians 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians 1:2	Grace [be] to you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 1:3	Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly [places] in Christ:
Ephesians 1:4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
Ephesians 1:5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
Ephesians 1:6	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
Ephesians 1:7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
Ephesians 1:8	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
Ephesians 1:9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
Ephesians 1:10	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; [even] in him:
Ephesians 1:11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
Ephesians 1:12	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
Ephesians 1:13	In whom ye also [trusted], after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
Ephesians 1:14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
Ephesians 1:15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
Ephesians 1:16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
Ephesians 1:17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
Ephesians 1:18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
Ephesians 1:19	And what [is] the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
Ephesians 1:20	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set [him] at his own right hand in the heavenly [places],
Ephesians 1:21	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
Ephesians 1:22	And hath put all [things] under his feet, and gave him [to be] the head over all [things] to the church,
Ephesians 1:23	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
Ephesians 2:1	And you [hath he quickened], who were dead in trespasses and sins;
Ephesians 2:2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:
Ephesians 2:3	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.
Ephesians 2:4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Ephesians 2:5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)
Ephesians 2:6	And hath raised [us] up together, and made [us] sit together in heavenly [places] in Christ Jesus:
Ephesians 2:7	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
Ephesians 2:8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:
Ephesians 2:9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.
Ephesians 2:10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
Ephesians 2:11	Wherefore remember, that ye [being] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;
Ephesians 2:12	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:
Ephesians 2:13	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
Ephesians 2:14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition [between us];
Ephesians 2:15	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, [even] the law of commandments [contained] in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, [so] making peace;
Ephesians 2:16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:
Ephesians 2:17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.
Ephesians 2:18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
Ephesians 2:19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
Ephesians 2:20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner [stone];
Ephesians 2:21	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
Ephesians 2:22	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
Ephesians 3:1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
Ephesians 3:2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
Ephesians 3:3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,
Ephesians 3:4	Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)
Ephesians 3:5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;
Ephesians 3:6	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:
Ephesians 3:7	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
Ephesians 3:8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;
Ephesians 3:9	And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:
Ephesians 3:10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
Ephesians 3:11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
Ephesians 3:12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
Ephesians 3:13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
Ephesians 3:14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Ephesians 3:15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,
Ephesians 3:16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;
Ephesians 3:17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,
Ephesians 3:18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;
Ephesians 3:19	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.
Ephesians 3:20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,
Ephesians 3:21	Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.
Ephesians 4:1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,
Ephesians 4:2	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;
Ephesians 4:3	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
Ephesians 4:4	[There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;
Ephesians 4:5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
Ephesians 4:6	One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and through all, and in you all.
Ephesians 4:7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
Ephesians 4:8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.
Ephesians 4:9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
Ephesians 4:10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)
Ephesians 4:11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
Ephesians 4:12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
Ephesians 4:13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
Ephesians 4:14	That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;
Ephesians 4:15	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:
Ephesians 4:16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.
Ephesians 4:17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
Ephesians 4:18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:
Ephesians 4:19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
Ephesians 4:20	But ye have not so learned Christ;
Ephesians 4:21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:
Ephesians 4:22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;
Ephesians 4:23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
Ephesians 4:24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.
Ephesians 4:25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.
Ephesians 4:26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
Ephesians 4:27	Neither give place to the devil.
Ephesians 4:28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with [his] hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.
Ephesians 4:29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
Ephesians 4:30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.
Ephesians 4:31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
Ephesians 4:32	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.
Ephesians 5:1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
Ephesians 5:2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
Ephesians 5:3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
Ephesians 5:4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
Ephesians 5:5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Ephesians 5:6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
Ephesians 5:7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
Ephesians 5:8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now [are ye] light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
Ephesians 5:9	(For the fruit of the Spirit [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
Ephesians 5:10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
Ephesians 5:11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove [them].
Ephesians 5:12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
Ephesians 5:13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
Ephesians 5:14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
Ephesians 5:15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
Ephesians 5:16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
Ephesians 5:17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord [is].
Ephesians 5:18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
Ephesians 5:19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
Ephesians 5:20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
Ephesians 5:21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
