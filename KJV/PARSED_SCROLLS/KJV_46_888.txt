Ephesians 5:22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
Ephesians 5:23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
Ephesians 5:24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.
Ephesians 5:25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
Ephesians 5:26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
Ephesians 5:27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
Ephesians 5:28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
Ephesians 5:29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
Ephesians 5:30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
Ephesians 5:31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
Ephesians 5:32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
Ephesians 5:33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife [see] that she reverence [her] husband.
Ephesians 6:1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
Ephesians 6:2	Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
Ephesians 6:3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
Ephesians 6:4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
Ephesians 6:5	Servants, be obedient to them that are [your] masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
Ephesians 6:6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
Ephesians 6:7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
Ephesians 6:8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether [he be] bond or free.
Ephesians 6:9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
Ephesians 6:10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
Ephesians 6:11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
Ephesians 6:12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high [places].
Ephesians 6:13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Ephesians 6:14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
Ephesians 6:15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
Ephesians 6:16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
Ephesians 6:17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
Ephesians 6:18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
Ephesians 6:19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
Ephesians 6:20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
Ephesians 6:21	But that ye also may know my affairs, [and] how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
Ephesians 6:22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and [that] he might comfort your hearts.
Ephesians 6:23	Peace [be] to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Ephesians 6:24	Grace [be] with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
Philippians 1:1	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
Philippians 1:2	Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and [from] the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
Philippians 1:4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
Philippians 1:5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
Philippians 1:6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:
Philippians 1:7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
Philippians 1:8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
Philippians 1:9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and [in] all judgment;
Philippians 1:10	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
Philippians 1:11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
Philippians 1:12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
Philippians 1:13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places];
Philippians 1:14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
Philippians 1:15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
Philippians 1:16	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
Philippians 1:17	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
Philippians 1:18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
Philippians 1:19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
Philippians 1:20	According to my earnest expectation and [my] hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether [it be] by life, or by death.
Philippians 1:21	For to me to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.
Philippians 1:22	But if I live in the flesh, this [is] the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
Philippians 1:23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
Philippians 1:24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh [is] more needful for you.
Philippians 1:25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
Philippians 1:26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
Philippians 1:27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
Philippians 1:28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
Philippians 1:29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
Philippians 1:30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear [to be] in me.
Philippians 2:1	If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
Philippians 2:2	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind.
Philippians 2:3	[Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
Philippians 2:4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
Philippians 2:5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
Philippians 2:6	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
Philippians 2:7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
Philippians 2:8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
Philippians 2:9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
Philippians 2:10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth;
Philippians 2:11	And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians 2:12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
Philippians 2:13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of [his] good pleasure.
Philippians 2:14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
Philippians 2:15	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;
Philippians 2:16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
Philippians 2:17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.
Philippians 2:18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
Philippians 2:19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
Philippians 2:20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
Philippians 2:21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
Philippians 2:22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.
Philippians 2:23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
Philippians 2:24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
Philippians 2:25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.
Philippians 2:26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.
Philippians 2:27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
Philippians 2:28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
Philippians 2:29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
Philippians 2:30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
Philippians 3:1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed [is] not grievous, but for you [it is] safe.
Philippians 3:2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
Philippians 3:3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.
Philippians 3:4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
Philippians 3:5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, [of] the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
Philippians 3:6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
Philippians 3:7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.
Philippians 3:8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things [but] loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them [but] dung, that I may win Christ,
Philippians 3:9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
Philippians 3:10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;
Philippians 3:11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
Philippians 3:12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but [this] one thing [I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
Philippians 3:14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
Philippians 3:15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
Philippians 3:16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.
Philippians 3:17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.
Philippians 3:18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:
Philippians 3:19	Whose end [is] destruction, whose God [is their] belly, and [whose] glory [is] in their shame, who mind earthly things.)
Philippians 3:20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
Philippians 3:21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
Philippians 4:1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.
Philippians 4:2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
Philippians 4:3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.
Philippians 4:4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.
Philippians 4:5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.
Philippians 4:6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
Philippians 4:7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.
Philippians 4:9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
Philippians 4:10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
Philippians 4:11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.
Philippians 4:12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
Philippians 4:13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
Philippians 4:14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.
Philippians 4:15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
Philippians 4:16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
Philippians 4:17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
Philippians 4:18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
Philippians 4:19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
Philippians 4:20	Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
Philippians 4:21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.
Philippians 4:22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
Philippians 4:23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
Colossians 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus [our] brother,
Colossians 1:2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Colossians 1:3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,
Colossians 1:4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love [which ye have] to all the saints,
Colossians 1:5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;
Colossians 1:6	Which is come unto you, as [it is] in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as [it doth] also in you, since the day ye heard [of it], and knew the grace of God in truth:
Colossians 1:7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;
Colossians 1:8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
Colossians 1:9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;
Colossians 1:10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Colossians 1:11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;
Colossians 1:12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
Colossians 1:13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated [us] into the kingdom of his dear Son:
Colossians 1:14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, [even] the forgiveness of sins:
Colossians 1:15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
Colossians 1:16	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
Colossians 1:17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
Colossians 1:18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all [things] he might have the preeminence.
Colossians 1:19	For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all fulness dwell;
Colossians 1:20	And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, [I say], whether [they be] things in earth, or things in heaven.
Colossians 1:21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in [your] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
Colossians 1:22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:
Colossians 1:23	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and [be] not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, [and] which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;
Colossians 1:24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:
Colossians 1:25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;
Colossians 1:26	[Even] the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:
Colossians 1:27	To whom God would make known what [is] the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:
Colossians 1:28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:
Colossians 1:29	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
Colossians 2:1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and [for] them at Laodicea, and [for] as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;
Colossians 2:2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;
Colossians 2:3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Colossians 2:4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.
Colossians 2:5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.
Colossians 2:6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, [so] walk ye in him:
Colossians 2:7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
Colossians 2:8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
Colossians 2:9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
Colossians 2:10	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
Colossians 2:11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:
Colossians 2:12	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with [him] through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.
Colossians 2:13	And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;
Colossians 2:14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
Colossians 2:15	[And] having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
Colossians 2:16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath [days]:
Colossians 2:17	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [is] of Christ.
Colossians 2:18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,
Colossians 2:19	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.
Colossians 2:20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,
Colossians 2:21	(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
Colossians 2:22	Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
Colossians 2:23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
Colossians 3:1	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.
Colossians 3:2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.
Colossians 3:3	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.
Colossians 3:4	When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.
Colossians 3:5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:
Colossians 3:6	For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
Colossians 3:7	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
Colossians 3:8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
Colossians 3:9	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;
Colossians 3:10	And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:
Colossians 3:11	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.
Colossians 3:12	Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;
Colossians 3:13	Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.
Colossians 3:14	And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.
Colossians 3:15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.
Colossians 3:16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.
Colossians 3:17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
Colossians 3:18	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.
Colossians 3:19	Husbands, love [your] wives, and be not bitter against them.
Colossians 3:20	Children, obey [your] parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
Colossians 3:21	Fathers, provoke not your children [to anger], lest they be discouraged.
Colossians 3:22	Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
Colossians 3:23	And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
Colossians 3:24	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
Colossians 3:25	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
Colossians 4:1	Masters, give unto [your] servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
Colossians 4:2	Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;
Colossians 4:3	Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:
Colossians 4:4	That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
Colossians 4:5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
Colossians 4:6	Let your speech [be] alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
Colossians 4:7	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, [who is] a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:
Colossians 4:8	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;
Colossians 4:9	With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known unto you all things which [are done] here.
Colossians 4:10	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)
Colossians 4:11	And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only [are my] fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.
Colossians 4:12	Epaphras, who is [one] of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
Colossians 4:13	For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them [that are] in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.
Colossians 4:14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
Colossians 4:15	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.
Colossians 4:16	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the [epistle] from Laodicea.
Colossians 4:17	And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
Colossians 4:18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace [be] with you. Amen.
1 Thessalonians 1:1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians [which is] in God the Father and [in] the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace [be] unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians 1:2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
1 Thessalonians 1:3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
1 Thessalonians 1:4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
1 Thessalonians 1:5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
1 Thessalonians 1:6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
1 Thessalonians 1:7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
1 Thessalonians 1:8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
1 Thessalonians 1:9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
1 Thessalonians 1:10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, [even] Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
1 Thessalonians 2:1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:
1 Thessalonians 2:2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.
1 Thessalonians 2:3	For our exhortation [was] not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:
1 Thessalonians 2:4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.
1 Thessalonians 2:5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God [is] witness:
1 Thessalonians 2:6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor [yet] of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.
1 Thessalonians 2:7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:
1 Thessalonians 2:8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.
1 Thessalonians 2:9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.
1 Thessalonians 2:10	Ye [are] witnesses, and God [also], how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:
1 Thessalonians 2:11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father [doth] his children,
1 Thessalonians 2:12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.
1 Thessalonians 2:13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received [it] not [as] the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.
1 Thessalonians 2:14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they [have] of the Jews:
1 Thessalonians 2:15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:
1 Thessalonians 2:16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
1 Thessalonians 2:17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.
1 Thessalonians 2:18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.
1 Thessalonians 2:19	For what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? [Are] not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
1 Thessalonians 2:20	For ye are our glory and joy.
1 Thessalonians 3:1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;
1 Thessalonians 3:2	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:
1 Thessalonians 3:3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.
1 Thessalonians 3:4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
1 Thessalonians 3:5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
1 Thessalonians 3:6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also [to see] you:
1 Thessalonians 3:7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:
1 Thessalonians 3:8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 3:9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;
1 Thessalonians 3:10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
1 Thessalonians 3:11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.
1 Thessalonians 3:12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all [men], even as we [do] toward you:
1 Thessalonians 3:13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
1 Thessalonians 4:1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.
1 Thessalonians 4:2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
1 Thessalonians 4:3	For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:
1 Thessalonians 4:4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
1 Thessalonians 4:5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:
1 Thessalonians 4:6	That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
1 Thessalonians 4:7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.
1 Thessalonians 4:8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.
1 Thessalonians 4:9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
1 Thessalonians 4:10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;
1 Thessalonians 4:11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;
1 Thessalonians 4:12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.
1 Thessalonians 4:13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.
1 Thessalonians 4:14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.
1 Thessalonians 4:15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.
1 Thessalonians 4:16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:
1 Thessalonians 4:17	Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1 Thessalonians 4:18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
1 Thessalonians 5:1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
1 Thessalonians 5:2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
1 Thessalonians 5:3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
1 Thessalonians 5:4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
1 Thessalonians 5:5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
1 Thessalonians 5:6	Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.
1 Thessalonians 5:7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
1 Thessalonians 5:8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
1 Thessalonians 5:9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
1 Thessalonians 5:10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
1 Thessalonians 5:11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
1 Thessalonians 5:12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
1 Thessalonians 5:13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. [And] be at peace among yourselves.
1 Thessalonians 5:14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].
1 Thessalonians 5:15	See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].
1 Thessalonians 5:16	Rejoice evermore.
1 Thessalonians 5:17	Pray without ceasing.
1 Thessalonians 5:18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
1 Thessalonians 5:19	Quench not the Spirit.
1 Thessalonians 5:20	Despise not prophesyings.
1 Thessalonians 5:21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
1 Thessalonians 5:22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.
1 Thessalonians 5:23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians 5:24	Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].
1 Thessalonians 5:25	Brethren, pray for us.
1 Thessalonians 5:26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
1 Thessalonians 5:27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
1 Thessalonians 5:28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.
2 Thessalonians 1:1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Thessalonians 1:2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 1:3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;
2 Thessalonians 1:4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
2 Thessalonians 1:5	[Which is] a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
2 Thessalonians 1:6	Seeing [it is] a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
2 Thessalonians 1:7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,
2 Thessalonians 1:8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Thessalonians 1:9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
2 Thessalonians 1:10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
2 Thessalonians 1:11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of [this] calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of [his] goodness, and the work of faith with power:
2 Thessalonians 1:12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 2:1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him,
2 Thessalonians 2:2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.
2 Thessalonians 2:3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
2 Thessalonians 2:4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
2 Thessalonians 2:5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2 Thessalonians 2:6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
2 Thessalonians 2:7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth [will let], until he be taken out of the way.
2 Thessalonians 2:8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
2 Thessalonians 2:9	[Even him], whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,
2 Thessalonians 2:10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
2 Thessalonians 2:11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:
2 Thessalonians 2:12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
2 Thessalonians 2:13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:
2 Thessalonians 2:14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2 Thessalonians 2:15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.
2 Thessalonians 2:16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given [us] everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,
2 Thessalonians 2:17	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.
2 Thessalonians 3:1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have [free] course, and be glorified, even as [it is] with you:
2 Thessalonians 3:2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all [men] have not faith.
2 Thessalonians 3:3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep [you] from evil.
2 Thessalonians 3:4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
2 Thessalonians 3:5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.
2 Thessalonians 3:6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.
2 Thessalonians 3:7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
2 Thessalonians 3:8	Neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:
2 Thessalonians 3:9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.
2 Thessalonians 3:10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.
2 Thessalonians 3:11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.
2 Thessalonians 3:12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.
2 Thessalonians 3:13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
2 Thessalonians 3:14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.
2 Thessalonians 3:15	Yet count [him] not as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.
2 Thessalonians 3:16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord [be] with you all.
2 Thessalonians 3:17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.
2 Thessalonians 3:18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.
1 Timothy 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, [which is] our hope;
1 Timothy 1:2	Unto Timothy, [my] own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
1 Timothy 1:3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
1 Timothy 1:4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: [so do].
1 Timothy 1:5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and [of] a good conscience, and [of] faith unfeigned:
1 Timothy 1:6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
1 Timothy 1:7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
1 Timothy 1:8	But we know that the law [is] good, if a man use it lawfully;
1 Timothy 1:9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
1 Timothy 1:10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
1 Timothy 1:11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1 Timothy 1:12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
1 Timothy 1:13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did [it] ignorantly in unbelief.
1 Timothy 1:14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy 1:15	This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
1 Timothy 1:16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
1 Timothy 1:17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, [be] honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
1 Timothy 1:18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
1 Timothy 1:19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
1 Timothy 1:20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1 Timothy 2:1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men;
1 Timothy 2:2	For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
1 Timothy 2:3	For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
1 Timothy 2:4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
1 Timothy 2:5	For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
1 Timothy 2:6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
1 Timothy 2:7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, [and] lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
1 Timothy 2:8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
1 Timothy 2:9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
1 Timothy 2:10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
1 Timothy 2:11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
1 Timothy 2:12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
1 Timothy 2:13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
1 Timothy 2:14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
1 Timothy 2:15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
1 Timothy 3:1	This [is] a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
1 Timothy 3:2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1 Timothy 3:3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;
1 Timothy 3:4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;
1 Timothy 3:5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)
1 Timothy 3:6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
1 Timothy 3:7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1 Timothy 3:8	Likewise [must] the deacons [be] grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;
1 Timothy 3:9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
1 Timothy 3:10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being [found] blameless.
1 Timothy 3:11	Even so [must their] wives [be] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.
1 Timothy 3:12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
1 Timothy 3:13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1 Timothy 3:14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:
1 Timothy 3:15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.
1 Timothy 3:16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
1 Timothy 4:1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
1 Timothy 4:2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
1 Timothy 4:3	Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
1 Timothy 4:4	For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
1 Timothy 4:5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1 Timothy 4:6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
1 Timothy 4:7	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness.
1 Timothy 4:8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
1 Timothy 4:9	This [is] a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
1 Timothy 4:10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
1 Timothy 4:11	These things command and teach.
1 Timothy 4:12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
1 Timothy 4:13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
1 Timothy 4:14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
1 Timothy 4:15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
1 Timothy 4:16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
1 Timothy 5:1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat [him] as a father; [and] the younger men as brethren;
1 Timothy 5:2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.
1 Timothy 5:3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy 5:4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.
1 Timothy 5:5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.
1 Timothy 5:6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
1 Timothy 5:7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.
1 Timothy 5:8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
1 Timothy 5:9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,
1 Timothy 5:10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.
1 Timothy 5:11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;
1 Timothy 5:12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
1 Timothy 5:13	And withal they learn [to be] idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
1 Timothy 5:14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
1 Timothy 5:15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.
1 Timothy 5:16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.
1 Timothy 5:17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
1 Timothy 5:18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer [is] worthy of his reward.
1 Timothy 5:19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.
1 Timothy 5:20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
1 Timothy 5:21	I charge [thee] before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
1 Timothy 5:22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.
1 Timothy 5:23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.
1 Timothy 5:24	Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some [men] they follow after.
1 Timothy 5:25	Likewise also the good works [of some] are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
1 Timothy 6:1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and [his] doctrine be not blasphemed.
1 Timothy 6:2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them], because they are brethren; but rather do [them] service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
1 Timothy 6:3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, [even] the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;
1 Timothy 6:4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1 Timothy 6:5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.
1 Timothy 6:6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1 Timothy 6:7	For we brought nothing into [this] world, [and it is] certain we can carry nothing out.
1 Timothy 6:8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
1 Timothy 6:9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and [into] many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.
1 Timothy 6:10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1 Timothy 6:11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.
1 Timothy 6:12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.
1 Timothy 6:13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and [before] Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;
1 Timothy 6:14	That thou keep [this] commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:
1 Timothy 6:15	Which in his times he shall shew, [who is] the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1 Timothy 6:16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom [be] honour and power everlasting. Amen.
1 Timothy 6:17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;
1 Timothy 6:18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;
1 Timothy 6:19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1 Timothy 6:20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane [and] vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:
1 Timothy 6:21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace [be] with thee. Amen.
2 Timothy 1:1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy 1:2	To Timothy, [my] dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy 1:3	I thank God, whom I serve from [my] forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;
2 Timothy 1:4	Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
2 Timothy 1:5	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.
2 Timothy 1:6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
2 Timothy 1:7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.
2 Timothy 1:8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;
2 Timothy 1:9	Who hath saved us, and called [us] with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,
2 Timothy 1:10	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:
2 Timothy 1:11	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
2 Timothy 1:12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2 Timothy 1:13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 1:14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy 1:15	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy 1:16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:
2 Timothy 1:17	But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found [me].
2 Timothy 1:18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2 Timothy 2:1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 2:2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy 2:3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
2 Timothy 2:4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of [this] life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
2 Timothy 2:5	And if a man also strive for masteries, [yet] is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
2 Timothy 2:6	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
2 Timothy 2:7	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy 2:8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
2 Timothy 2:9	Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, [even] unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
2 Timothy 2:10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2 Timothy 2:11	[It is] a faithful saying: For if we be dead with [him], we shall also live with [him]:
2 Timothy 2:12	If we suffer, we shall also reign with [him]: if we deny [him], he also will deny us:
2 Timothy 2:13	If we believe not, [yet] he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy 2:14	Of these things put [them] in remembrance, charging [them] before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, [but] to the subverting of the hearers.
2 Timothy 2:15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
2 Timothy 2:16	But shun profane [and] vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
2 Timothy 2:17	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
2 Timothy 2:18	Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
2 Timothy 2:19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
2 Timothy 2:20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
2 Timothy 2:21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, [and] prepared unto every good work.
2 Timothy 2:22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy 2:23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
2 Timothy 2:24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all [men], apt to teach, patient,
2 Timothy 2:25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
2 Timothy 2:26	And [that] they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
2 Timothy 3:1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2 Timothy 3:2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2 Timothy 3:3	Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
2 Timothy 3:4	Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
2 Timothy 3:5	Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
2 Timothy 3:6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
2 Timothy 3:7	Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy 3:8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
2 Timothy 3:9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as theirs also was.
2 Timothy 3:10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
2 Timothy 3:11	Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them] all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy 3:12	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
2 Timothy 3:13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
2 Timothy 3:14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];
2 Timothy 3:15	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy 3:16	All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
2 Timothy 3:17	That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
2 Timothy 4:1	I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;
2 Timothy 4:2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
2 Timothy 4:3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;
2 Timothy 4:4	And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
2 Timothy 4:5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
2 Timothy 4:6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.
2 Timothy 4:7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith:
2 Timothy 4:8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.
2 Timothy 4:9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
2 Timothy 4:10	For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
2 Timothy 4:11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
2 Timothy 4:12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy 4:13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring [with thee], and the books, [but] especially the parchments.
2 Timothy 4:14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
2 Timothy 4:15	Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
2 Timothy 4:16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: [I pray God] that it may not be laid to their charge.
2 Timothy 4:17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2 Timothy 4:18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy 4:19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy 4:20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
2 Timothy 4:21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2 Timothy 4:22	The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit. Grace [be] with you. Amen.
Titus 1:1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
Titus 1:2	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
Titus 1:3	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus 1:4	To Titus, [mine] own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, [and] peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
Titus 1:5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
Titus 1:6	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus 1:7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
Titus 1:8	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
Titus 1:9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
Titus 1:10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
Titus 1:11	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
Titus 1:12	One of themselves, [even] a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians [are] alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
Titus 1:13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
Titus 1:14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
Titus 1:15	Unto the pure all things [are] pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving [is] nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
Titus 1:16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny [him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
Titus 2:1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
Titus 2:2	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
Titus 2:3	The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
Titus 2:4	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus 2:5	[To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
Titus 2:6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
Titus 2:7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine [shewing] uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
Titus 2:8	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
Titus 2:9	[Exhort] servants to be obedient unto their own masters, [and] to please [them] well in all [things]; not answering again;
Titus 2:10	Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus 2:11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
Titus 2:12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
Titus 2:13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus 2:14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
Titus 2:15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
Titus 3:1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,
Titus 3:2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.
Titus 3:3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.
Titus 3:4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
Titus 3:5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
Titus 3:6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus 3:7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus 3:8	[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.
Titus 3:9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus 3:10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;
Titus 3:11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.
Titus 3:12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.
Titus 3:13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus 3:14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus 3:15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.
Philemon 1:1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy [our] brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
Philemon 1:2	And to [our] beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
Philemon 1:3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon 1:4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
Philemon 1:5	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
Philemon 1:6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
Philemon 1:7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
Philemon 1:8	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
Philemon 1:9	Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech [thee], being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
Philemon 1:10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
Philemon 1:11	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
Philemon 1:12	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
Philemon 1:13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Philemon 1:14	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
Philemon 1:15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
Philemon 1:16	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
Philemon 1:17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon 1:18	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth [thee] ought, put that on mine account;
Philemon 1:19	I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand, I will repay [it]: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
Philemon 1:20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
Philemon 1:21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
Philemon 1:22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
Philemon 1:23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
Philemon 1:24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
Philemon 1:25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.
Hebrews 1:1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
Hebrews 1:2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by [his] Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;
Hebrews 1:3	Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
Hebrews 1:4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
Hebrews 1:5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
Hebrews 1:6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.
Hebrews 1:7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.
Hebrews 1:8	But unto the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Hebrews 1:9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
Hebrews 1:10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
Hebrews 1:11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
Hebrews 1:12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.
Hebrews 1:13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
Hebrews 1:14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?
Hebrews 2:1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.
Hebrews 2:2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;
Hebrews 2:3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];
Hebrews 2:4	God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?
Hebrews 2:5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
Hebrews 2:6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Hebrews 2:7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
Hebrews 2:8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
Hebrews 2:9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
Hebrews 2:10	For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Hebrews 2:11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
Hebrews 2:12	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.
Hebrews 2:13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.
Hebrews 2:14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;
Hebrews 2:15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.
Hebrews 2:16	For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.
Hebrews 2:17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
Hebrews 2:18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
Hebrews 3:1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;
Hebrews 3:2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.
Hebrews 3:3	For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.
Hebrews 3:4	For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.
Hebrews 3:5	And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;
Hebrews 3:6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
Hebrews 3:7	Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,
Hebrews 3:8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
Hebrews 3:9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
Hebrews 3:10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.
Hebrews 3:11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)
Hebrews 3:12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.
Hebrews 3:13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
Hebrews 3:14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;
Hebrews 3:15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
Hebrews 3:16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.
Hebrews 3:17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?
Hebrews 3:18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?
Hebrews 3:19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.
Hebrews 4:1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
Hebrews 4:2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].
Hebrews 4:3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
Hebrews 4:4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
Hebrews 4:5	And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.
Hebrews 4:6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
Hebrews 4:7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
Hebrews 4:8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
Hebrews 4:9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
Hebrews 4:10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.
Hebrews 4:11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
Hebrews 4:12	For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Hebrews 4:13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
Hebrews 4:14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.
Hebrews 4:15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.
Hebrews 4:16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
Hebrews 5:1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:
Hebrews 5:2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.
Hebrews 5:3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.
Hebrews 5:4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as [was] Aaron.
Hebrews 5:5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.
Hebrews 5:6	As he saith also in another [place], Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 5:7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;
Hebrews 5:8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;
Hebrews 5:9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;
Hebrews 5:10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 5:11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.
Hebrews 5:12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which [be] the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.
Hebrews 5:13	For every one that useth milk [is] unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.
Hebrews 5:14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, [even] those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
Hebrews 6:1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Hebrews 6:2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
Hebrews 6:3	And this will we do, if God permit.
Hebrews 6:4	For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,
Hebrews 6:5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,
Hebrews 6:6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.
Hebrews 6:7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:
Hebrews 6:8	But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.
Hebrews 6:9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.
Hebrews 6:10	For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.
Hebrews 6:11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:
Hebrews 6:12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
Hebrews 6:13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,
Hebrews 6:14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.
Hebrews 6:15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
Hebrews 6:16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.
Hebrews 6:17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:
Hebrews 6:18	That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:
Hebrews 6:19	Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;
Hebrews 6:20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 7:1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;
Hebrews 7:2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;
Hebrews 7:3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.
Hebrews 7:4	Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
Hebrews 7:5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:
Hebrews 7:6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.
Hebrews 7:7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
Hebrews 7:8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
Hebrews 7:9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.
Hebrews 7:10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
Hebrews 7:11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?
Hebrews 7:12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.
Hebrews 7:13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.
Hebrews 7:14	For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.
Hebrews 7:15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,
Hebrews 7:16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.
Hebrews 7:17	For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
Hebrews 7:18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.
Hebrews 7:19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.
Hebrews 7:20	And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:
Hebrews 7:21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)
Hebrews 7:22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.
Hebrews 7:23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:
Hebrews 7:24	But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.
Hebrews 7:25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.
Hebrews 7:26	For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
Hebrews 7:27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
Hebrews 7:28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
Hebrews 8:1	Now of the things which we have spoken [this is] the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
Hebrews 8:2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
Hebrews 8:3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore [it is] of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
Hebrews 8:4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
Hebrews 8:5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, [that] thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
Hebrews 8:6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
Hebrews 8:7	For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
Hebrews 8:8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
Hebrews 8:9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
Hebrews 8:10	For this [is] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
Hebrews 8:11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
Hebrews 8:12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews 8:13	In that he saith, A new [covenant], he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old [is] ready to vanish away.
Hebrews 9:1	Then verily the first [covenant] had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.
Hebrews 9:2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein [was] the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.
Hebrews 9:3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;
Hebrews 9:4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein [was] the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
Hebrews 9:5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.
Hebrews 9:6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service [of God].
Hebrews 9:7	But into the second [went] the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and [for] the errors of the people:
Hebrews 9:8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
Hebrews 9:9	Which [was] a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;
Hebrews 9:10	[Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed [on them] until the time of reformation.
Hebrews 9:11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;
Hebrews 9:12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us].
Hebrews 9:13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:
Hebrews 9:14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
Hebrews 9:15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions [that were] under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.
Hebrews 9:16	For where a testament [is], there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.
Hebrews 9:17	For a testament [is] of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.
Hebrews 9:18	Whereupon neither the first [testament] was dedicated without blood.
Hebrews 9:19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,
Hebrews 9:20	Saying, This [is] the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.
Hebrews 9:21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.
Hebrews 9:22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.
Hebrews 9:23	[It was] therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
Hebrews 9:24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, [which are] the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:
Hebrews 9:25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;
Hebrews 9:26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
Hebrews 9:27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:
Hebrews 9:28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.
Hebrews 10:1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, [and] not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.
Hebrews 10:2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.
Hebrews 10:3	But in those [sacrifices there is] a remembrance again [made] of sins every year.
Hebrews 10:4	For [it is] not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.
Hebrews 10:5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:
Hebrews 10:6	In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
Hebrews 10:7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.
Hebrews 10:8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and [offering] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure [therein]; which are offered by the law;
Hebrews 10:9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.
Hebrews 10:10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once [for all].
Hebrews 10:11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:
Hebrews 10:12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;
Hebrews 10:13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.
Hebrews 10:14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.
Hebrews 10:15	[Whereof] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,
Hebrews 10:16	This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;
Hebrews 10:17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
Hebrews 10:18	Now where remission of these [is, there is] no more offering for sin.
Hebrews 10:19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,
Hebrews 10:20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
Hebrews 10:21	And [having] an high priest over the house of God;
Hebrews 10:22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.
Hebrews 10:23	Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;)
Hebrews 10:24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:
Hebrews 10:25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.
Hebrews 10:26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,
Hebrews 10:27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
Hebrews 10:28	He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
Hebrews 10:29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
Hebrews 10:30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance [belongeth] unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
Hebrews 10:31	[It is] a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
Hebrews 10:32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
Hebrews 10:33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.
Hebrews 10:34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.
Hebrews 10:35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.
Hebrews 10:36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
Hebrews 10:37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.
Hebrews 10:38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if [any man] draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
Hebrews 10:39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.
Hebrews 11:1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
Hebrews 11:2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
Hebrews 11:3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
Hebrews 11:4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.
Hebrews 11:5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
Hebrews 11:6	But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.
Hebrews 11:7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
Hebrews 11:8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.
Hebrews 11:9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:
Hebrews 11:10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.
Hebrews 11:11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.
Hebrews 11:12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
Hebrews 11:13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
Hebrews 11:14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.
Hebrews 11:15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.
Hebrews 11:16	But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.
Hebrews 11:17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],
Hebrews 11:18	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:
Hebrews 11:19	Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.
Hebrews 11:20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.
Hebrews 11:21	By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.
Hebrews 11:22	By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.
Hebrews 11:23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
Hebrews 11:24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;
Hebrews 11:25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
Hebrews 11:26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.
Hebrews 11:27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
Hebrews 11:28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
Hebrews 11:29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.
Hebrews 11:30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.
Hebrews 11:31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.
Hebrews 11:32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:
Hebrews 11:33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
Hebrews 11:34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.
Hebrews 11:35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:
Hebrews 11:36	And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:
Hebrews 11:37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;
Hebrews 11:38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.
Hebrews 11:39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:
Hebrews 11:40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
Hebrews 12:1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset [us], and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
