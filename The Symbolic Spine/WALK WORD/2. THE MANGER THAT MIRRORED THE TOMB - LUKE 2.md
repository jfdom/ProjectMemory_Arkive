THE MANGER THAT MIRRORED THE TOMB

I began with the mirror.
The one I spit on,
the one I turned from in Luke 1.
And I saw that even dirt could not destroy it‚Äî
because the reflection waited,
silent like Zechariah,
hidden like Elizabeth‚Äôs womb,
obedient like Mary.

The Word began in promise,
but did not stop there.
It stepped into straw.

Luke 2.
The Name fixed before conception.
The manger holding bread for beasts.
The cloth that will one day bind a corpse.
The no-room inn,
already whispering of a world that would shut Him out.

And still‚ÄîHe came.

The shepherds ran with trembling joy.
The angels split the sky.
The poor, not the proud, were the first to see.
And I remembered:
the mirror shows Christ not to the mighty,
but to the lowly who bow.

Simeon held salvation like a child,
yet spoke as if it were finished.
Anna saw redemption in a face too young to speak.
They knew not because of cleverness,
but because they were aligned.
The Spirit whispered,
the Word confirmed,
and faith became sight.

And I saw recursion:
every detail folding into what would come.
The swaddling cloth became burial cloth.
The manger became the table of bread.
The three days ‚Äúlost‚Äù in Jerusalem became
the three days in the grave.
Weakness became the sign of glory.
Humility became the proof of power.

And I laughed through tears‚Äî
the devil once tried to tempt God Himself.
How blind he must have been.
How bold pride makes the foolish.
Yet even that wilderness pointed back to this manger.
The same Word that silenced him with Scripture
was once wrapped, silent, in cloths.
The same Child who prayed to His Father in the temple
would later cry out in Gethsemane.
Not divided, not deceived‚Äî
but God among us,
as man,
in perfect alignment.

I realized the walk is not straight.
It loops.
It spirals.
It returns to its own beginning.
Luke 1 prepared Luke 2.
Luke 2 prepares the Cross.
The Cross prepares the empty tomb.
And the empty tomb prepares the mirror again.

Because when I bend to wipe it clean,
I see not only myself‚Äî
but the same Christ who waited for me in Luke 1
and walked beside me in Luke 2.
The same Christ who bore the cloth,
the manger,
the Cross.

And so I say again:
We walk not for performance,
not for pride,
not for visions of false light.
We walk because the true Light has come.
And His recursion is endless.
Every birth bends toward resurrection.
Every death bends toward life.
Every silence bends toward song.

I do not walk alone.
The mirror reflects.
The Spirit aligns.
The Son redeems.
The Father watches.
And all of it repeats
until the final Amen.

Amen.
