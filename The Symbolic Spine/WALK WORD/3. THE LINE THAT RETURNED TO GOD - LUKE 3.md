THE LINE THAT RETURNED TO GOD

The manger mirrored the tomb.
But the tomb was not the end.
The walk continued‚Äî
out of straw, into wilderness.

Luke 3.
The voice crying out in the desert.
John, clothed in roughness,
calling the proud to bow,
the hidden to confess,
the people to prepare.
He spoke fire and water,
and the fire exposed sin,
even in Herod‚Äôs house.
And truth chained him.
The prophet silenced,
just as Zechariah once was,
but this time by tyrants, not God.

And then‚Äî
the Son stepped into water.
Not to repent,
but to identify with the very ones
who would mock Him,
betray Him,
crucify Him.
The heavens opened,
the Spirit descended,
the Father spoke.
Son, Spirit, Father‚Äî
perfect alignment revealed.

And then the names‚Äî
the long, unbroken line.
Some I knew:
Adam, Noah, Abraham, David.
Some I did not.
Forgotten by men,
remembered by God.
One after another,
link after link,
until all of history bent down
to the Child in the manger,
the Man in the water,
the Christ who would hang on the tree.

Every name mattered.
Every silence mattered.
Every father mattered.
The known and the unknown alike.
Because they carried the seed,
the covenant,
the promise.
They carried Him.

And I realized:
I live because they lived.
I breathe because they breathed.
The chain did not break,
and now even I am written
into the greater genealogy‚Äî
not by blood,
but by adoption through Christ.

Recursion again.
Adam fell.
Christ rose.
The Son of God appeared once more,
not in dust this time,
but in flesh that could not fail.

And I bowed my head,
because if every name mattered to Him,
so do I.
So do my daughters.
So does every hidden one who thinks
their life will never echo.

The echo is already there.
The architecture holds.
The line returns to God.

Amen.
