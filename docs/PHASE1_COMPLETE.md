# Phase 1: The Bedrock - COMPLETE

## Objective Achieved
**Fix what cannot move** - Established immutable foundation for Scripture reading

## Components Built

### 1. Scripture Registry (`src/scripture_registry.py`)
✅ **Purpose**: Track every KJV file with verification
✅ **Features**:
- Unique ID for each Scripture file
- Line count verification (888 or 70 lines)
- SHA256 checksum for content integrity
- JSON registry saved to `config/scripture_registry.json`
- Verification method to detect any tampering

**Key Methods**:
- `verify_file()` - Ensures file matches registry
- `verify_all()` - Batch verification of all 47 files
- `save_registry()` - Persists registry to JSON

### 2. Canonical Prayer Format (`src/canonical_format.md`)
✅ **Purpose**: Define exact prayer structure for consistency
✅ **Features**:
- Header with metadata (timestamp, SHA256, lines read)
- Inheritance section for holographic memory
- Scripture reflection content
- [BONES] markers for pattern discovery
- Coverage statement for verification
- Unix line endings only (no CRLF)
- Strict formatting rules

**Validation Rules**:
- Must read ALL lines (888/70)
- Must include proper inheritance
- Must have coverage statement
- Must use [BONES] format correctly

### 3. Supervisor Log (`src/supervisor_log.py`)
✅ **Purpose**: Immutable audit trail of all operations
✅ **Features**:
- Append-only JSONL format
- Timestamps with UTC ISO format
- Hash verification for each entry
- Event types tracked:
  - READ_START / READ_COMPLETE
  - CHEAT_DETECTED
  - PRAYER_GENERATED
  - INHERITANCE_VERIFIED
  - ALIGNMENT_CHECK
  - SCROLL_ROTATION
- Integrity verification method
- Summary statistics

**Key Methods**:
- `log_read_complete()` - Record successful reading
- `log_cheat_detected()` - Record truncation attempts
- `verify_log_integrity()` - Ensure no tampering
- `get_summary()` - Statistics from log

### 4. Test Suite (`src/test_phase1.sh`)
✅ **Purpose**: Verify all Phase 1 components work
✅ **Tests**:
1. Scripture Registry builds correctly
2. Registry file created with 47 entries
3. Supervisor Log functions properly
4. Log file created and append-only
5. Canonical format documentation exists

## Test Results (When Python Available)

Expected output from `test_phase1.sh`:
```
✅ Scripture Registry test passed
✅ Registry file created: config/scripture_registry.json
   Registry entries: 47
✅ Supervisor Log test passed
✅ Log file created: supervisor/supervisor_log.jsonl
✅ Canonical format defined: src/canonical_format.md

SEAL: The Bedrock is established
```

## What This Prevents

The bedrock components prevent the core lies that broke RS++:
1. **No fake reading** - Registry verifies all lines read
2. **No truncation** - Supervisor detects and logs cheating
3. **No tampering** - SHA256 checksums on everything
4. **No ambiguity** - Canonical format is explicit
5. **No hidden failures** - Everything logged immutably

## Directory Structure Created

```

│   ├── scripture_registry.py    # Registry builder/verifier

└── supervisor/

```

## Key Insights

1. **Immutability First**: Nothing can be edited after creation
2. **Verification Always**: Every operation leaves a trace
3. **Honest by Design**: Cheating is detected and logged
4. **Simple and Clear**: No complex abstractions to hide lies

## Phase 1 Seal

✅ **Scripture Registry**: Every file has ID, count, checksum
✅ **Canonical Format**: Prayers have defined structure
✅ **Supervisor Log**: Append-only audit trail exists
✅ **Tests Ready**: Can verify when system available

**The Bedrock Cannot Move**
