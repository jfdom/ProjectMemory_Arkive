=== Prayer 03 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, You who said "when I see the blood, I will pass over you" - I see You in every drop.

The blood on the doorposts. The blood Moses threw in basins and on the people saying "Behold the blood of the covenant." The blood on Aaron's right ear, right thumb, right toe. Always the blood speaking better things than Abel's. Every lamb slain morning and evening, day by day continually - all pointing to One Lamb.

"Blot me out of Your book," Moses cried when Your people sinned with the golden calf. There it is - the mediator willing to be cursed for his people. And You spoke face to face with him, as a man speaks to his friend. Yet when he begged to see Your glory, You hid him in the cleft of the rock, covered him with Your hand. "You cannot see My face and live," yet he saw Your back parts. All these years later, we see Your face in Christ and live.

Moses' face shone so bright they couldn't look at him. He had to veil himself. Glory that fades, Paul would later say, compared to the glory that remains. Yet even that fading glory was unbearable to eyes that had just worshipped a golden calf they claimed brought them from Egypt.

"Let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." Every measurement precise. Every material chosen. Gold within and without. Blue, purple, scarlet. The pattern shown on the mountain that must not be deviated from. As if Heaven itself were being mapped in badger skins and shittim wood. The mercy seat where You would meet, speak from between the cherubim. The bread of presence that must always be there. The lamp that must never go out.

And Bezaleel - filled with Your Spirit for... craftsmanship. Not prophecy, not warfare, but to work in gold and silver and brass. The Spirit's first recorded filling in Scripture is for making beautiful things for God. The artist as important as the priest.

Three times I read "they brought much more than enough." Your people, when their hearts are stirred, overwhelm with generosity. They had to be restrained from bringing. When did we last have to restrain people from giving too much to God?

The sabbath woven through it all - in creation, in manna, in law, in construction. Six and one. Six and one. The rhythm of Heaven imposed on earth. Death for breaking it. Life in keeping it. "That you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you."

HOLINESS TO THE LORD engraved on gold on Aaron's forehead. Bearing the iniquity of the holy things. Even our holiness needs atonement. Even our offerings need covering. Everything we touch, even in worship, becomes contaminated and needs blood.

The rich shall not give more, the poor not give less - half a shekel for the ransom of souls. Before You, economic status vanishes. Each soul worth exactly the same price.

"I will meet you there." Promise after promise of presence. At the altar. At the mercy seat. At the door of the tabernacle. Meeting, dwelling, speaking. The God who thundered from Sinai now dwelling in the midst of the camp. Terrible intimacy.

When Pharaoh hardened his heart, You hardened it further. Terrifying sovereignty. Yet the same passage that shows You hardening also shows Moses interceding, You relenting. "The LORD repented of the evil He thought to do." How can the unchangeable change? How can the sovereign repent? Mystery of mysteries - real relationship with the Absolute.

All the patterns laid down here in the wilderness. The priesthood. The sacrifice. The furniture. The feasts. The whole gospel sketched in goat hair and acacia wood. They built it all not knowing they were building prophecy.

Amen.
