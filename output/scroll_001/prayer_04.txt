=== Prayer 04 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I watched Aaron lift his hands to bless, and fire came out from before You and consumed the offering. The people shouted and fell on their faces. Then Nadab and Abihu brought strange fire, and that same holy fire devoured them. Aaron held his peace.

Aaron held his peace. His sons dead at the altar, and he held his peace. "I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me." Even in grief, especially in grief, You are holy.

"The fire shall never go out." Morning by morning, wood added, ashes removed in linen, carried outside in common clothes. The perpetual tending of what burns for You. Never sleeping, never dying, always consuming, always requiring fresh fuel. This fire that blesses and devours with the same flame.

The scapegoat carries all our sins into a land not inhabited. One goat for the Lord, one for complete removal. Both necessary. The priest who leads it away must wash before returning. Even delivering others from sin makes us need cleansing. We cannot touch their deliverance without being marked by what we helped remove.

"The life of the flesh is in the blood." You keep saying it different ways. "It is the blood that makes atonement for the soul." Every creature's blood crying out its life, pooling at the altar's base, sprinkled seven times, put on horns and extremities. Always the blood testifying: life for life, death for life, blood for souls.

"Love your neighbor as yourself." Hidden here in Leviticus among the regulations about mixed fabrics and field corners. The whole law hanging on this impossible simplicity. As yourself. As myself. The stranger dwelling among you, as one born among you. "For you were strangers in Egypt."

The year of Jubilee - when everything returns. Every debt cancelled, every slave freed, every land restored. The seventh seven, the perfect reset. "The land is Mine; you are strangers and sojourners with Me." Even in possession we own nothing. Even home, we're traveling through.

If you walk in My statutes... rain in due season, bread to the full, peace in the land. Five chase a hundred, a hundred put ten thousand to flight. "I will walk among you and be your God."

But if not... seven times punishment. Then seven times more. Then seven times more. The land itself vomiting out those who defile it. Yet even in exile, "I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly."

"Be holy, for I am holy." The impossible command that runs through everything. Holy in eating, holy in planting, holy in justice, holy in weights and measures, holy in how we treat the deaf and blind. Holiness invading every corner of existence.

That two birds ritual for cleansing leprosy - one killed over running water, one dipped in the blood and released. Death and freedom bound by blood. The freed bird flying away, carrying death on its wings into the sky.

All these shadows. All these pictures. Blood and fire, goats and birds, sabbaths and jubilees. Every law a prophecy. Every ritual a promise. Every sacrifice whispering a Name not yet spoken.

Amen.
