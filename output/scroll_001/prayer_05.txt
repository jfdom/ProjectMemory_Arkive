=== Prayer 05 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in the covenant that cannot be broken. "Yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away." Seven times punishment, yet You remember Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. The land itself waits for them, enjoying its sabbaths while they weep in exile, but You never forget.

The Levites taken instead of the firstborn - every firstborn belongs to You since that night in Egypt when death passed over. You took a whole tribe as Your inheritance. "They are wholly given unto me." Living sacrifices walking among the people.

Moses crying out "Kill me, I pray thee, if thou deal thus with me." The burden too heavy for one man. Then the Spirit that was upon him taken and put upon seventy elders. They prophesied once and stopped, but two kept prophesying in the camp. Joshua wanted them forbidden. Moses: "Would God that all the Lord's people were prophets."

The graves of lust where they buried those who craved. Always wanting what was behind instead of where You're leading. The fish of Egypt free, but slavery attached. Your manna sweet as honey, but they called it light bread. Our contempt for daily grace.

Miriam and Aaron speaking against Moses about his Ethiopian wife, but really about authority. "Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses?" Then You came down in the pillar of cloud. "With him will I speak mouth to mouth." Miriam leprous white as snow. Aaron begging. Moses praying. Seven days outside the camp. The people waiting. Even Your discipline holds mercy.

Twelve spies, but only two saw with faith. "We be not able" versus "We are well able." The same giants, different eyes. Caleb trying to still the people. The evil report spreading like plague. "Would God we had died in Egypt!" Your glory appearing when they wanted to stone Your servants.

"How long will this people provoke me?" Yet You forgave at Moses' word. But those who saw Your glory and still didn't believe - forty years, one year for each day they searched the land. Their carcasses in the wilderness, but their children entering in. The punishment that's also preparation.

The earth opening its mouth for Korah. "Ye take too much upon you." The congregation fleeing from the screaming ground. Two hundred fifty censers of strange fire beaten into a covering for the altar - rebellion hammered into memorial. The next day they murmured again. Fourteen thousand seven hundred dead before Aaron ran with incense between the living and the dead. The plague stopped where the priest stood.

Aaron's rod that budded. Not just budded - blossoms and almonds in one night. Life from dead wood. Authority confirmed by fruitfulness. Kept before the testimony forever. No more questioning who You've chosen.

The red heifer whose ashes cleanse from death's contamination. Burned complete - skin, flesh, blood, dung. Cedar, hyssop, scarlet thrown into the burning. The priest unclean until evening. The clean gathering the ashes. Everything about death makes us need cleansing, even cleaning up death's mess.

Moses striking the rock instead of speaking. "Must we fetch you water?" The water came anyway, but Moses couldn't enter the promise. One moment of taking Your glory. Aaron dying on Mount Hor, his garments on Eleazar. The congregation mourning thirty days.

The brazen serpent. "Every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live." The poison countered by looking at poison's image lifted up. They had to look to live. Faith is often just lifting our eyes.

Balaam's donkey seeing the angel. Three times turning aside, three times beaten. Then You opened the donkey's mouth. "What have I done unto thee?" The prophet rebuked by his beast. The seer who couldn't see. Hired to curse but could only bless. "I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord."

"God is not a man, that he should lie." Standing between the curser and Your people. Every curse turning to blessing in his mouth. "How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed?" Seven altars, seven offerings, but the same blessing. "There is no enchantment against Jacob."

I see You everywhere - in the fire that consumes and purifies, in the Spirit distributed but not diminished, in the earth that swallows rebellion, in the rod that flowers from death, in the serpent that heals, in the donkey that sees, in the curse that must bless.

You're the priest who stands between the living and dead. You're the firstborn given wholly to God. You're the rock that gives water whether struck or spoken to. You're the One lifted up that we might look and live.

Amen.
