=== Prayer 06 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in Balaam's final prophecy: "I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel."

A Star. A Sceptre. Not now, not nigh, but coming. The prophet hired to curse sees furthest into the promise. His eyes opened in a trance, seeing what no one else could see. The man who came for gold glimpses glory.

"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!" Even the enemy's prophet must speak beauty. Like valleys spread forth, like gardens by rivers, like trees the Lord planted. Your people through hostile eyes still shine like cedar trees beside the waters.

Seven altars, seven offerings, three times trying to curse. But "Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee." The ancient promise to Abraham echoing through a pagan prophet's mouth. God's word unchanged whether spoken by friend or foe.

Then immediately after the Star prophecy - whoredom at Baalpeor. From highest vision to lowest fall. Twenty-four thousand dead in the plague. They who couldn't be cursed, cursing themselves.

But Phinehas. Rising with a javelin while everyone else weeps at the tabernacle door. One act of holy violence stopping the plague. "Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace... an everlasting priesthood." Peace through the javelin. Priesthood through zeal.

"Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not." Tucked in the census like a whisper of grace. Their father swallowed by earth for rebellion, but they lived. Sometimes judgment passes over the children. Sometimes the sons escape their father's grave.

The census after plague. Counting who survived. "They became a sign" - Korah's company, the 250 with censers. Not just punishment but signpost. Every rebellion becomes testimony. Even our failures preach.

I see You in the Star that Balaam saw but couldn't reach. In the blessing that can't be reversed. In Phinehas's javelin that brought peace. In Korah's children who lived when their father died.

You're coming. Not now, not nigh, but coming. A Star rising where prophets' eyes strain to see.

Amen.
