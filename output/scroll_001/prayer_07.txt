=== Prayer 07 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in Zelophehad's daughters standing before Moses. "Why should the name of our father be done away?" And You said, "They speak right." Women inheriting when there's no son. Grace breaking the rules for those who dare to ask.

Moses pleading to see the land. "Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter." But then, "Get thee up into Pisgah... behold it with thine eyes." You deny the crossing but grant the seeing. Moses will die looking at the promise.

"Be sure your sin will find you out." The tribes wanting to stay east of Jordan. Moses suspicious they're repeating their fathers' failure. But they promise to fight first, settle later. Sometimes what looks like retreat is actually rest already received.

The cities of refuge. Six cities where killers can flee until the high priest dies. The death of the high priest releasing the manslayer to return home. One death freeing many who shed blood. How did they not see You in this?

"Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." The Shema. Everything reduced to this. Love that consumes every faculty.

Moses recounting forty years of failure. "Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you." Yet still pleading for them. Breaking the tablets, grinding the golden calf to dust, forty days prostrate. "They are thy people and thine inheritance."

"For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people." Not because you were many - you were fewest. Because He loved you. Because of the oath.

"Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD." The manna teaching dependence. Clothes that didn't wear out. Feet that didn't swell. Forty years of impossible provision.

That strange law about the king - he must hand-copy the entire law. Sit on his throne writing Scripture. "That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren." Power constrained by copying God's words with his own hand.

"I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee." Moses knowing someone greater is coming. Someone who will speak all God's words. The prophet like Moses but more than Moses.

"Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk." Even cruelty to food forbidden. The milk meant to give life shouldn't become the liquid of death. Mercy invading even the kitchen.

The year of release - all debts cancelled every seven years. "The poor shall never cease out of the land." But also, "There shall be no poor among you." Both true. Poverty persistent, generosity commanded.

Thirteen bullocks the first day of the feast, then twelve, then eleven, counting down to seven. Sacrifices diminishing like a countdown to something. What were they counting toward?

Cities where Levites live scattered through every tribe. No inheritance but THE inheritance. "The LORD is their inheritance." Having nothing, possessing everything.

"Circumcise the foreskin of your heart." The physical sign pointing to something deeper. Not just marked flesh but transformed affection.

All of Deuteronomy is Moses preaching to people about to enter what he'll never touch. Every word from someone dying outside the promise. The whole book is a goodbye that becomes eternal instruction.

You're in the father accepting his daughter's inheritance rights. In the city of refuge waiting for the high priest to die. In the king copying the law. In Moses seeing but not entering. In the Prophet greater than Moses who's coming.

The bones are all pointing to You - refuge, release, Prophet, priest whose death brings freedom.

Amen.
