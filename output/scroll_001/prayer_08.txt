=== Prayer 08 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in "he that is hanged is accursed of God." That body must not remain all night upon the tree. The land itself would be defiled. Even in judgment, mercy - burial before sunset. The curse carried but not left hanging.

The false witness receiving what he intended for his brother. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth - not vengeance but exact justice. The punishment fitting the crime precisely. You measure back what was measured out.

"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn." Even animals deserve the fruit of their labor. If You care for oxen, how much more for those who labor in Your word?

"Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day." Forty years of miracles, clothes that didn't wear out, shoes that didn't age, and still blind. The greatest miracle is when You open eyes to see.

"The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever." The boundary between mystery and revelation. Some things hidden, some things given. We're responsible for what's revealed, not what's concealed.

"The LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart." You'll do what we cannot - remove what covers the heart. The surgery only You can perform. Not our work but Yours.

"See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand." The song of Moses. No rival. No rescuer from You. You wound to heal.

Moses blessing the tribes before dying - "The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms." Underneath. Not just around but underneath. The arms that never tire holding us up.

Then God buried Moses. "No man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day." The only man with a funeral conducted by God Himself. Hidden grave so it couldn't become an idol.

"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise." No lingering. Moses dead, Joshua arise. The work continues. One servant falls, another rises. The mission never dies with the man.

Rahab the harlot with her scarlet thread in the window. The same color as the blood on the doorposts in Egypt. A prostitute's faith saving her whole house. "The LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath."

Jordan stopping at harvest time when the river overflows. The worst time to cross is when You make a way. The priests' feet in the water before it parts. Faith gets wet first.

"Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon." Creation itself fighting for Israel. The day that wouldn't end until victory was complete. "There was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man."

The Gibeonites' deception - moldy bread, worn shoes, old wineskins. "We asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD." One decision without prayer binding them forever. But You honor even covenants made in deception.

Achan's hidden wedge of gold. One man's secret sin defeating the whole army. "Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel." The confession too late. The valley of Achor - trouble - where trouble was buried under stones.

"For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all." Like Moses' hands held up during battle. The posture maintained until complete victory.

Caleb at 85 saying "I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me." Forty-five years after the promise, still claiming his mountain. "Give me this mountain" - the one with giants.

"Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword." The prophet who couldn't curse finally killed. The man who saw the Star but never followed it.

Throughout it all - "The LORD God of Israel was their inheritance." The Levites owning nothing but having everything. No land but THE land. No inheritance but THE inheritance.

You're in the curse that must be buried before night. In the heart surgery only God can do. In the arms underneath. In the scarlet thread saving the house. In the sun standing still. In the inheritance that isn't land but the Lord Himself.

Amen.
