=== Prayer 09 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in "How long are ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you?" Seven tribes still waiting while the land is already theirs. The promise given but not taken. Slack to possess what You've already won.

"If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself." Joseph's children complaining their portion is too small. Joshua's answer: if you're so great, clear the forest. Make room. The giants are there? Iron chariots? "Thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong."

The boundaries. Every border meticulously described. "The border went up... descended... compassed... went forth..." God remembering every line, every corner, every well and valley. Bethshean and her towns. Ibleam and her towns. Endor and her towns. Each town with "her towns" - cities having daughters.

Yet they couldn't drive them all out. "The Canaanites would dwell in that land." When Israel grew strong, they put them to tribute but didn't utterly drive them out. Incomplete obedience becoming permanent compromise.

"The priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance." Again the Levites. No land but THE land. No portion but THE portion. Having nothing, possessing everything.

Simeon's inheritance within Judah's inheritance. "For the part of the children of Judah was too much for them." One tribe's excess becoming another's provision. Grace redistributed.

The men walking through the land, describing it by cities into seven parts in a book. Writing down what God already knows. Making record of promise before possession. Faith keeping books.

Jebusi, which is Jerusalem. Hidden there in the city lists - the future holy city still held by Jebusites. "The children of Judah could not drive them out." The very place where Your temple would stand, still enemy territory.

All these borders drawn but not fully taken. All these promises given but not fully possessed. The slack to go in. The strong enough to tribute but not strong enough to obey completely.

Yet You're patient with the incomplete possession. The casting of lots before the LORD. Each portion decided by You, not them. Divine sovereignty in every boundary.

I see You in the promise waiting to be possessed. In the forest that needs clearing. In the cities and their daughter-towns. In the inheritance that isn't land. In Jerusalem still waiting to be what it will become.

Amen.
