=== Prayer 10 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in "There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass." Every promise kept. Yet Israel still slack to possess, still leaving enemies within. The land given but not fully taken.

The altar by Jordan - "a great altar to see to." Not for sacrifice but for witness. They built it from fear their children would be told "ye have no part in the LORD." A monument to belonging. The whole nation ready for civil war over an altar that was never meant for burning, only for remembering.

"There arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD." One generation serving, the next forgetting. The cycle beginning: sin, servitude, supplication, salvation. Then sin again. "Every man did that which was right in his own eyes."

Deborah under her palm tree, Barak refusing to go without her. "The journey shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." Then Jael with her tent peg, Sisera's temple pierced while he slept. The mighty general killed by hospitality turned holy violence.

Gideon threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it. "The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour." He answers: "If the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us?" The angel calling him mighty while he hides in fear. You see what we'll become, not what we are.

The fleece wet, ground dry. Then reversed. Needing signs upon signs. Then 32,000 reduced to 300. "The people are too many... lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." Victory through deliberate weakness.

Three hundred with trumpets, torches, broken pitchers. Light hidden in clay until the breaking. "The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon." The enemy destroying themselves in confusion while Your people just stand and shine.

Then the ephod Gideon made - "all Israel went thither a whoring after it." The very man who destroyed Baal's altar creating a new snare. Victory becoming idolatry.

Jephthah's terrible vow. "Whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house." His only daughter with timbrels and dances. "I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back." She asking only for two months to bewail her virginity on the mountains. The daughters of Israel lamenting her four days every year.

"Say now Shibboleth." The word that betrays origin. Forty-two thousand killed because they couldn't pronounce judgment correctly.

Samson. "No razor shall come on his head." Strength not in muscles but in consecration. The riddle from the lion's carcass: "Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the strong came forth sweetness." Death becoming honey.

Delilah pressing daily until "his soul was vexed unto death." He tells all. "I will go out as at other times." But he knew not that the LORD was departed from him. Blind, grinding at the mill. Hair growing again.

"Let me die with the Philistines." Killing more in death than life. Between the pillars, bringing down the house.

"Every man did that which was right in his own eyes." The Levite's concubine at Gibeah - horror matching Sodom. Her body divided twelve ways. Israel nearly destroying Benjamin to purish the sin. Then stealing wives at Shiloh's feast so Benjamin wouldn't disappear.

Ruth saying "Whither thou goest, I will go." The Moabitess cleaving when the Israelites scatter. Boaz dropping handfuls on purpose. The nearer kinsman refusing, the shoe removed. Ruth the great-grandmother of David.

Hannah praying silently, lips moving without sound. Eli thinking she's drunk. "I have poured out my soul before the LORD." Samuel - asked of God, given back to God. "As long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD."

Through it all - promises kept but not possessed, judges raised then forgotten, strength in weakness, death in vows, foreigners more faithful than natives. Every generation having to choose again.

You keep Your word even when we don't take it. You raise deliverers even from hiding places. You win through torches in broken clay.

Amen.
