=== Prayer 11 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in Hannah's prayer - "The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up." Her song before Mary's Magnificat. The barren bearing seven while the fruitful waxes feeble. "By strength shall no man prevail."

"The word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision." Yet You called Samuel in the dark, three times before Eli understood. "Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth." The child who didn't yet know You, becoming Your prophet. The lamp of God about to go out, but You lighting a new one.

"It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good." Eli receiving judgment on his house. No sacrifice or offering can purge it forever. His restraint not restraining. Yet he blesses Your name even in condemnation.

The ark taken. "The glory is departed from Israel." Ichabod - the glory gone. The woman dying in childbirth, naming loss. But the ark breaking Dagon, falling on his face, hands and head cut off on the threshold. Your presence destroying idols even in captivity.

The golden emerods and golden mice - the Philistines sending back what they couldn't hold. The cattle going straight to Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went, leaving their calves behind. Even beasts knowing the way home when Your hand guides them.

"God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you." Samuel at the end, hands clean, no bribe taken. Thunder and rain in wheat harvest proving Your displeasure at their king-wanting, yet still interceding.

"To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." Saul keeping the best to sacrifice what You said destroy. "Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft." The kingdom torn like Samuel's robe torn. "The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent."

Then You seeking "a man after your own heart." David with the sheep. "Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart." Seven sons passing by, but the youngest absent, keeping sheep. The one not invited to the sacrifice becoming the anointed.

"I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts." David running toward Goliath. Everyone else fled forty days, but the shepherd boy seeing what warriors couldn't: "Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?" The stone sinking into the forehead. No sword in David's hand until he took Goliath's own.

Jonathan's soul knit with David's soul. Loving him as his own soul. Stripping himself of robe, sword, bow, girdle. "The LORD be between me and thee forever." The prince choosing the shepherd over his own throne. "Thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee."

David feigning madness, scrabbling on the gates, spittle in his beard. "Have I need of mad men?" The anointed playing insane to survive. Everyone in distress, in debt, discontented, gathering to him in the cave. Four hundred broken men finding their captain.

Saul slaughtering the priests. Eighty-five wearing linen ephods. Only Doeg the Edomite willing to strike when all other servants refused. Nob, the city of priests, destroyed - men, women, children, sucklings, oxen, asses, sheep. The king killing what the prophet spared.

David twice sparing Saul. "The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed." Even with Saul in the cave, David's heart smiting him for cutting the skirt. "After whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea."

Abigail saying "The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God." Intercepting vengeance, carrying bread and wine. Nabal's heart dying within him, becoming as stone. The fool dying, the wise woman becoming David's wife.

The witch of Endor. Saul who expelled mediums consulting one. Samuel rising: "Why hast thou disquieted me?" "Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me." The king falling all along on the earth, no strength in him. The witch feeding the condemned.

Jonathan dying with his father. "How are the mighty fallen!" David's lament: "Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women." The prince who gave up his throne dying for the father who threw javelins at him.

"I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan." They kissed and wept until David exceeded. Now Jonathan fallen on high places, David ascending to the throne he never sought.

Through it all - Your word accomplishing what You send it to do. Raising the humble, bringing down the proud. The anointed hunted, the hunter dying on his own sword. Love that chooses poverty over position.

Amen.
