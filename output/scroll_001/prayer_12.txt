=== Prayer 12 of Scroll 001 ===

Lord, I see You in "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh." After seven years of division, Israel comes to David confessing what was always true. We are one body. The civil war ending with recognition of kinship.

Jerusalem finally taken. The Jebusites mocking: "The blind and the lame will keep you out." But David took the stronghold of Zion. What seemed impossible for generations, accomplished. The city that was always meant to be Yours, finally Yours.

"When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees." You going before, rustling in the leaves. The signal to move. Not when we're ready but when You rustle. The battle won by listening for Your movement in the trees.

Uzzah reaching out to steady the ark. "God smote him there for his error." The same impulse to help that killed. Good intentions toward holy things still bringing death. We cannot steady what You carry. Our help is sometimes our judgment.

David dancing with all his might, girded only with a linen ephod. The king becoming less than a king to worship. Michal despising him through the window - Saul's daughter unable to understand David's heart. "I will be yet more vile than thus." Lower still for You.

Michal barren unto death. The one who despised worship bearing no fruit. She who mocked dancing before You, herself unable to dance with life in her womb.

"Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?" You refusing David's offer. "I have walked in a tent." You don't need our buildings. You've been moving, not settling. The God who dwells in motion, not monuments.

But then the promise: "He shall build an house for my name." Not David but David's son. The throne established forever. "I will be his father, and he shall be my son." The covenant that cannot be broken even by sin - chastened but not cast away.

"Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house?" David sitting before You, overwhelmed. Not standing to pray but sitting, like a child before a father. "What can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant."

"For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart." Not for David's righteousness but for Your word's sake. Your promise driving Your faithfulness, not our performance.

The complete scroll - from "In the beginning" to "according to thine own heart." From Creation speaking to David sitting speechless. From separation of light and darkness to "we are thy bone and thy flesh." From Eden lost to Jerusalem taken. From brothers killing brothers to brothers recognizing they're one body.

Every prayer has carried every prayer before it. The accumulation complete for this scroll. Hannah's song echoed in David's dancing. Moses' tabernacle echoed in "I have walked in a tent." Aaron's sons' strange fire echoed in Uzzah's touch. The chosen younger echoed in Solomon not yet born.

Twelve prayers of witness. Twelve stones of remembrance. Each one containing all before it, like the tribes of Israel - separate but one, distinct but united, individual but incorporated.

The architecture has held. The inheritance has accumulated. The first scroll complete.

Yet this is only the beginning. 72 more prayers in six more scrolls. Then the second reading where "In the beginning" will contain all of this - David dancing, Jonathan dying, the cities of refuge, the Star not yet come.

We are thy bone and thy flesh. What was always true finally recognized. The recursion revealing what was always there.

Amen.
