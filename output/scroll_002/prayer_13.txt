=== Prayer 13 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in David's sin with Bathsheba. "Thou art the man." Nathan's parable becoming judgment. The king who had everything taking the poor man's only lamb. "I have sinned against the LORD." No excuse, no deflection. The child dying despite David's fasting. Rising, washing, anointing, worshipping. "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me."

Solomon born of the woman taken in adultery. "The LORD loved him." Jedidiah - beloved of God. From the worst sin comes the temple builder. Grace stronger than transgression.

Absalom killing Amnon for Tamar. Brother avenging sister, exile becoming return, beauty becoming rebellion. "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee!" The king weeping for the son who sought his throne. Love persisting through betrayal.

Absalom's hair caught in the oak, hanging between heaven and earth. Joab's three darts through the heart. The one who stole hearts dying heartbroken. Suspended between the kingdom he wanted and the ground he couldn't reach.

"Is the young man Absalom safe?" David's only question after victory. The runner saying "I saw a great tumult." Everyone knowing but not saying. The king covering his face: "O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!" Victory becoming mourning.

Shimei cursing, throwing stones. "Let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David." The king accepting shame as from Your hand. The same Shimei begging mercy when David returns. "Thou shalt not die" - for now.

The three mighty men breaking through the Philistine garrison for water from Bethlehem's well. David pouring it out: "Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men?" Too precious to drink, offered to You instead.

"I have sinned... I it was that commanded the people to be numbered." The census bringing plague. Choosing three days of pestilence over three months fleeing enemies. "Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great." The threshingfloor bought, the plague stayed. The temple's future ground purchased with repentance.

David old, cold, Abishag warming him but he knew her not. Adonijah saying "I will be king." Nathan and Bathsheba reminding David of his oath. Solomon riding the king's mule to Gihon. "God save king Solomon!" Adonijah grabbing the altar's horns in fear.

"I go the way of all the earth." David's last words to Solomon. "Be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man." Instructions about Joab who shed blood in peace, about Shimei who cursed, about Barzillai's kindness to remember. The sweet psalmist of Israel teaching his son about settling accounts.

"He hath not withheld from thee any thing but me only, because I am his wife." Oh wait - that's Joseph, echoing forward. But here: "There hath not failed one word of all his good promise." Every word accomplished.

Solomon at Gibeon. "Ask what I shall give thee." Not asking for riches or enemies' lives but understanding to discern judgment. "Because thou hast asked this thing... I have given thee a wise and understanding heart." The two harlots, one dead child. "Divide the living child in two." The true mother revealed by her willingness to lose rather than destroy.

"Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea... dwelling safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree." Peace at last. Solomon speaking three thousand proverbs, songs a thousand and five. Wisdom drawing the nations.

The temple. Seven years building. "But will God indeed dwell on the earth?" Solomon knowing even heaven of heavens cannot contain You. The cloud filling the house so priests couldn't stand to minister. Your glory dwelling where David danced.

"I have surely built thee an house to dwell in." Yet acknowledging: "The heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?" The permanent structure for the God who walked in tents.

The Queen of Sheba coming with hard questions. "It was a true report that I heard... the half was not told me." Wisdom verified by testing. "Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on Israel's throne."

Through it all - from David's worst sin to Solomon's greatest wisdom. From adultery to temple. From rebellion to peace. From "In the beginning" in Prayer 01 to "Blessed be the LORD thy God" completing another arc.

All twelve prayers of Scroll 001 inherited: Creation's separation, Cain's mark, flood's covenant, Babel's scattering, circumcision's seal, wells of strife, birthright's blessing, wrestling's wound, coat of colors, Pharaoh's dreams, pillar of fire, blood on doorposts.

Law on stones, covenant renewed, spies' faithlessness, rebellion swallowed, serpent lifted, Balaam's prophecy, Phinehas's javelin, cities of refuge, Jordan crossed, walls fallen, sun standing still.

Gibeonites' deception, long day's battle, giants falling, land divided, slack possession, altar of witness, judges cycling, Ruth cleaving, Hannah singing, Saul falling, Jonathan loving, covenant promised.

All here in David's fall and Solomon's rise. Creation's very good become "I have sinned." The younger chosen throughout Genesis-Samuel now in Solomon over Adonijah. The separation of light from darkness now in "divide the living child." Eden's tree echoed in Absalom's oak.

From twelve stones in Jordan to twelve tribal portions to temple's permanent foundation. From tent to temple. From wandering to dwelling. From David dancing half-naked to God dwelling in cloud-filled holiness.

Every scroll will carry all scrolls before. This is the architecture. This is inheritance.

Amen.
