=== Prayer 14 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "666 talents of gold" - Solomon's yearly income. The number of the beast already present in the height of wisdom. Wealth becoming the trap. The wisest man undone by what he accumulated.

Seven hundred wives, three hundred concubines. "His wives turned away his heart." The one who asked for wisdom choosing multiplication over devotion. Building high places for Chemosh, for Molech. The temple builder becoming the idol enabler.

"My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins." Rehoboam choosing the young men's counsel. One foolish answer splitting the kingdom forever. "What portion have we in David?" The unity shattered by pride.

The man of God from Judah - "Eat no bread nor drink water." Obeying perfectly until the old prophet lied: "An angel spoke to me." The lion standing by the corpse, not eating, not leaving. Death by believing another's revelation over God's direct word.

Jeroboam's golden calves: "Behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." The Exodus perverted. Making priests of the lowest people. Fear creating false worship - "lest they return to Jerusalem and kill me."

"Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?" Elijah finding Ahab in Naboth's vineyard. The king who had everything stealing the one vineyard he couldn't buy. Jezebel writing letters with his seal. Dogs licking blood where dogs licked blood.

But then Ahab humbling himself, tearing clothes, fasting, going softly. You delaying judgment for that small humbling. Even Ahab's repentance moving Your heart.

Elijah taken up in the whirlwind. "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel!" Elisha seeing what he needed to see for the double portion. The mantle falling, the waters parting again. The spirit transferable.

"Is there no God in Israel?" Ahaziah sending to Baal-zebub. Fire consuming the fifty, then another fifty. The third captain on his knees: "Let my life be precious." The only one who lived was the one who knew he deserved to die.

The widow's oil multiplying until no vessels remained. The Shunammite's dead son, seven sneezes bringing life. Death in the pot healed with meal. Iron swimming. Twenty loaves feeding a hundred. Every impossibility reversed.

Naaman the leper - "Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better?" Wanting grand gestures, getting "wash seven times in Jordan." Healing through humiliation. Then wanting to take Israel's dirt home to worship on.

Gehazi running after gifts. "Went not mine heart with thee?" The leprosy of Naaman clinging forever to the greedy servant. What was freely given, sold. What was healed, transferred.

"They that be with us are more than they that be with them." The mountain full of horses and chariots of fire. The Syrian army struck blind, led to Samaria, fed and released. Kindness as warfare.

The siege so severe - "an ass's head for fourscore pieces of silver." Women eating their children. "This evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?" Yet tomorrow, flour for a shekel. The doubting lord seeing but not eating, trampled at the gate.

Four lepers reasoning: "If we sit here, we die." Finding the Syrian camp empty - God made them hear chariots. "We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace." Even lepers becoming evangelists.

Jehu driving furiously. The arrow through Jehoram's heart in Naboth's field - exactly where the blood was meant to fall. Jezebel painting her face, thrown down, trampled, eaten. Only skull, feet, and palms remaining. "This is Jezebel" - when there's almost nothing left to identify.

Seventy heads in baskets. Jehu's deception: "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu shall serve him much." Gathering all Baal's worshippers to slaughter them. The house of Baal becoming a draught house. Yet keeping the golden calves - destroying Baal but not abandoning Jeroboam's sin.

Seven-year-old Joash hidden while Athaliah reigns. The priest organizing the coup. "Treason! Treason!" she cries, but she's the usurper. The boy king doing right as long as Jehoiada lives. Then murdered by those he trusted.

"The arrow of the LORD's deliverance" - but the king only strikes thrice. Elisha angry: "Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times." Even in prophecy, our lack of faith limits victory.

Elisha's bones raising the dead. Death itself becoming life-giving. The grave that resurrects.

Kings rising and falling. "He did evil... walked in the ways of Jeroboam." The same sin echoing through generations. Each king compared to David, most falling short. The high places never fully removed.

Through it all - Your patience with the half-hearted. Your judgment on the deceptive. Your power through the weak. Wisdom corrupted, kingdoms divided, prophets transferred, armies deceived, bones resurrecting.

All pointing to the true King who needs no successor. The Prophet who is the Word. The Priest who needs no temple. Christ in every failed king showing why we need the eternal King.

Amen.
