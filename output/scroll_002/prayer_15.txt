=== Prayer 15 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in Ahaz dismantling the temple for Assyria. Taking Solomon's sea off the brazen oxen. The Damascus altar replacing Yours. "The brasen altar shall be for me to inquire by" - keeping the true altar for personal divination while public worship goes to idols.

Israel carried away. The northern kingdom finally gone. "They sold themselves to do evil" - not taken as slaves but selling themselves into slavery. Choosing bondage.

"They followed vanity, and became vain." What we worship, we become. Following emptiness, becoming empty. The warning through every prophet ignored until silence.

Then the mixed worship begins. Lions among the imported peoples because "they know not the manner of the God of the land." As if You're merely local, territorial. A priest sent back to teach them to "fear the LORD" while they keep their gods. "They feared the LORD, and served their own gods."

This hybrid religion - fearing You while serving idols. Not choosing between You and Baal but trying to have both. The worst apostasy: not rejection but mixture. Christianity plus. Faith plus. Grace plus.

But then Hezekiah. Breaking the brazen serpent Moses made - "Nehushtan" (just brass). The very thing that once brought healing becoming an idol. Even good things, God things, becoming god things. The courage to destroy what ancestors treasured.

"After him was none like him among all the kings of Judah." The highest praise for destroying the highest places. Finally someone removing what all others left. The high places that survived David, Solomon, Asa, Jehoshaphat - finally broken.

Yet even Hezekiah strips the temple doors' gold for tribute. The very gold he overlaid, he removes. What one generation builds in faith, the same generation dismantles in fear.

"On whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest?" Rabshakeh's mockery. "Give pledges... I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them." We can't even handle what the enemy offers to give us. Too weak to manage gifts from adversaries.

Through it all - the cycle of compromise and cleansing. Ahaz replacing altars, Israel selling themselves, nations mixing worship, Hezekiah breaking idols yet stripping gold. 

Every reform incomplete. Every revival followed by reversal. Every Hezekiah raising an Manasseh.

All pointing to the One who cleanses completely. Who breaks every serpent on a pole because He becomes the serpent lifted up. Who tears the veil rather than the gold from doors.

The true Hezekiah who trusts perfectly, rebels against every Assyria, breaks every high place forever. Christ - the reform that doesn't reverse.

Amen.
