=== Prayer 17 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in David's census bringing plague, yet choosing "Let me fall into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man." Even in judgment, trusting Your mercy over human mercy. The angel standing between earth and heaven, sword drawn over Jerusalem - Christ as both judge and intercessor.

"Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned... but as for these sheep, what have they done?" David taking responsibility, not blaming Satan who provoked him. The true king protects the flock even when he's the one who endangered them.

The threshingfloor of Ornan becoming the temple site. Where judgment stopped, worship begins. "I will not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost." David refusing free grace because grace demands everything.

"In my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold." In trouble, not triumph, preparing. The afflicted king gathering more than the prosperous king will build with. Our worst seasons producing materials for God's best purposes.

Then the endless divisions - priests in 24 courses, Levites numbered, singers prophesying with harps. "They cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar." No hierarchy in God's lottery. The small as likely as the great.

Obededom blessed for keeping the ark, now his sons are gatekeepers. What blessed your house becomes your family's service. Grace creating obligation, blessing becoming duty.

"But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly?" David's prayer of astonishment. "Of thine own have we given thee." Recognizing even our giving is receiving. We offer God what was always His.

"We are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow." The king at his height confessing transience. Building permanent temple while admitting impermanence.

Solomon made king the second time - because first times don't always take. Needing to re-establish what was already established. Some thrones require multiple sittings.

Then Chronicles' version of Solomon's wisdom - asking not just for wisdom but "that I may go out and come in before this people." Wisdom to lead, not just to know. The difference between intelligence and understanding.

Again the temple building, but Chronicles emphasizes: Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac. Building where sacrifice was prevented. The temple on the spot where God provided the ram.

Six hundred talents of gold just for the Most Holy Place. The nails alone fifty shekels of gold. Holiness is expensive. The closer to God's presence, the more precious the materials.

"But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him?" Solomon knowing the absurdity while doing it anyway. Building what cannot contain, housing the unhouseable.

"As the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound" - then the cloud fills the temple. Unity in worship brings the presence. Not excellence but oneness triggers glory.

"For there is no man that sinneth not" - Solomon's prayer acknowledging universal failure even at the temple's dedication. The building consecrated with confession of inadequacy.

Fire from heaven consuming the sacrifice. The priests unable to enter because of glory. Success that excludes the successful. Achievement that prevents the achievers from entering.

"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven." The famous formula, but note the sequence: humbling before praying, seeking face not just hand, turning not just asking.

Pharaoh's daughter moved out because "My wife shall not dwell in the house of David... because the places are holy." Solomon protecting holiness by segregating his foreign wife. Already the compromise beginning.

The Queen of Sheba again: "the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me." Truth exceeding report. Reality surpassing rumor. But we know what's coming - this wisdom will turn to folly.

666 talents of gold. Chronicles confirms Kings. The number of abundance becoming the number of the beast.

"My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins." Rehoboam's boast shattering the kingdom. One sentence undoing forty years of Solomon's building.

The priests and Levites leaving Israel for Judah because Jeroboam "ordained him priests for the devils." The faithful fleeing to where worship remains true. Migration following liturgy.

"They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them." Even minimal humility moves God. Rehoboam's slight bending preventing total breaking.

Jehoram killing all his brothers. Then his bowels falling out in disease. Dying "without being desired." The most damning epitaph: no one wanted him alive, no one mourned him dead.

Joash doing right "all the days of Jehoiada the priest." Righteousness by proximity. Good by association. Then killing Zechariah, Jehoiada's son, in the temple court. "The LORD look upon it, and require it." The dying words becoming judgment.

Amaziah worshipping the gods of the people he defeated. Adopting the theology of the losers. "Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people?"

Uzziah's engines of war, "marvellously helped, till he was strong. But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up." Strength becoming weakness. Success creating the pride that destroys success. Leprosy breaking out while holding the censer - disease manifesting in the act of presumption.

"The eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him." God actively searching for hearts to strengthen. The divine surveillance seeking targets for blessing.

Jehoshaphat's battle where singing preceded victory. "When they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments." Worship as warfare. Praise triggering divine ambush.

"Neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee." Jehoshaphat's perfect prayer. Admission of ignorance with declaration of dependence.

Hezekiah opening doors Ahaz shut. First year, first month, first priority: restore worship. The reformer beginning with what the rebel ended.

The Levites "more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests." Sometimes the assistants exceed the appointed. The helpers holier than the helped.

Through it all - building and destroying, reforming and reversing, wisdom becoming folly, strength becoming weakness. Every human king failing somehow. All pointing to the need for the King who needs no second coronation, whose wisdom never turns to folly, whose strength perfects in weakness.

Christ - the temple that can contain God because He IS God. The priest and sacrifice together. The King whose finger is gentle and whose yoke is easy.

Amen.
