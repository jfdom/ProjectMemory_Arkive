=== Prayer 18 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests." Sometimes those not chosen for highest service serve highest. The assistants exceeding the anointed. Not position but heart determining holiness.

The priests too few to flay all the offerings - overwhelmed by sudden abundance. When revival comes faster than religion can process it. The structures of worship insufficient for the reality of return.

Passover in the second month - because they couldn't keep it at the proper time. Grace allowing late observance. You'd rather have delayed obedience than no obedience. The calendar bending to accommodate return.

"For they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written." Generations of compromise suddenly confronted by the actual commands. Reading what was always written but never followed.

The posts going city to city, "but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them." The invitation to return met with ridicule. Yet "Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves." The few responding while the many mock.

Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun eating the Passover unclean. "The good LORD pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek God... though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary." Heart preparation trumping ritual purity. Intent over exactitude.

"And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people." Not just forgave but healed. The unclean Passover becoming medicine. Broken rules bringing wholeness.

The feast extended another seven days spontaneously. "And they kept other seven days with gladness." When seven days aren't enough. When prescribed worship overflows its boundaries.

"Since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem." Not since the temple's builder had such joy been seen. Hezekiah reaching back past centuries of failure to touch Solomon's glory.

Then immediately: breaking images, cutting groves, destroying high places. Joy producing destruction of idols. True worship unable to coexist with false. The Passover lamb's blood requiring all leaven removed.

The tithe creating heaps. "Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty." Obedience creating surplus. Giving producing having.

"After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came." After revival, attack. After obedience, siege. The pattern: restoration triggers retaliation.

Stopping the waters so Assyria won't find them. Practical warfare - denying resources. Faith doesn't mean foolishness. Trusting God while stopping fountains.

"With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles." Hezekiah's great declaration. Not denying Assyria's power but declaring greater power. The arithmetic of faith: God plus anything equals majority.

Sennacherib's servants mocking: "Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars?" Interpreting reform as reduction. Seeing consolidation of worship as limitation of God. The enemy not understanding that less altars means more power.

"No god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand." The boast that invites divine response. Comparing the living God to idols. The blasphemy that triggers intervention.

Through it all - the Levites more upright than priests, the unclean eating Passover and being healed, joy overflowing prescription, giving creating abundance, reform triggering attack, but "with us is the LORD our God."

All pointing to Christ - the helper who exceeds the high priest, who makes the unclean clean, whose joy bursts all boundaries, who is our abundance, who faces down every Assyria saying "It is finished."

Amen.
