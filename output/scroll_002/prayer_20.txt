=== Prayer 20 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate." Haman's everything poisoned by one man's refusal to bow. All his glory worthless because of one standing witness. Pride unable to enjoy abundance while dignity remains unbowed.

"On that night could not the king sleep." Insomnia as providence. The exact night before genocide, sleeplessness. Reading chronicles at random, finding Mordecai's unrewarded deed. No sleep becoming salvation. Your hand in restlessness.

Haman entering to request Mordecai's death, asked instead "What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour?" Pride assuming it means himself, prescribing his own humiliation. Having to parade Mordecai in the very honor he designed for himself. The gallows-builder becoming the herald.

"If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him." Even Haman's wife prophesying his doom. The seed of Abraham blessed, those who curse them cursed. Ancient promise activating.

Esther revealing: "We are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed." The queen identifying with the condemned. "Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?" The king not knowing he authorized it. Haman falling on the couch, the king returning: "Will he force the queen also before me in the house?" Misread posture sealing fate.

"Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai." Harbonah's perfect timing. The gallows meant for the righteous receiving the wicked. "Hang him thereon." Justice using injustice's own instruments.

"The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour." The reversal complete. Purim - the lot cast for destruction becoming celebration. "Many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them." Persecution creating conversion.

"On the spoil laid they not their hand." Three times emphasized. Not taking plunder though permitted. This isn't about gain but survival. Refusing to profit from necessary defense.

Then Job: "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright." No mention of Israel, no covenant context. Righteousness outside the chosen people. God having witnesses everywhere.

Satan among the sons of God. "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it." The restless prosecutor. "Doth Job fear God for nought?" Accusing faith of being transactional. The question that launches all suffering: Is love real without reward?

"Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD." Job's first response perfect. Worshipping in loss. Blessing while bereaved.

"Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life." Satan's escalation. From possessions to flesh. "He is in thine hand; but save his life." Permission with limits. Evil leashed.

Job scraping boils with pottery. His wife: "Curse God, and die." The final temptation through closest relationship. "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" Still not sinning with his lips.

Seven days of silent sitting. Friends who came to comfort, overwhelmed by the magnitude. Sometimes grief requires presence without words. Then Job breaking silence with curse on his birth - "Let the day perish wherein I was born."

"Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both." Job longing for a mediator. Someone to stand between him and God. The cry for Christ before knowing Christ's name.

"Miserable comforters are ye all." Religion without revelation. Theology without empathy. Friends becoming tormentors through their certainty about suffering's cause.

"Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." Faith's pinnacle. Trust beyond transaction. Clinging when everything suggests releasing. Love proved real by persistence through loss.

"I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God." Job seeing resurrection. Knowing the Redeemer before the incarnation. Faith reaching through death to life.

"But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold." Understanding suffering as refining. The fire not destroying but purifying. Trial producing treasure.

"Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!" Job's prayer answered - his words preserved forever. The sufferer's cry becoming Scripture. Pain transformed to permanence.

"But where shall wisdom be found?" The whole discourse on wisdom's hiding. "The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding." Wisdom not in knowing why but in knowing Who.

"I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame." Job's former glory - not wealth but service. His greatness measured in those he helped. Loss including loss of ability to bless others.

"If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom." Job knowing Adam's story. The first sin remembered outside Genesis. Universal knowledge of the fall.

Elihu's anger at both Job and friends. The young man waiting, then exploding: "There is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." Age doesn't monopolize wisdom. Youth can carry revelation.

"God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not." Divine communication persistent but unrecognized. Dreams, visions, circumstances - God always speaking, rarely heard.

Through it all - providence in insomnia, justice through injustice's tools, suffering without explanation, faith without transaction, the cry for a mediator, wisdom in fearing God, the Redeemer known before revelation.

All pointing to Christ - the true Daysman between God and man, the Redeemer who lives, the wisdom of God hidden but revealed, the righteous sufferer who trusts unto death, who turns Purim's lots from death to life.

Amen.
