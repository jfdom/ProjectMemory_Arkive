=== Prayer 21 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom." Elihu prophesying Christ - the messenger, the interpreter, the one among thousands who stands between God and man. The ransom found before the cross revealed it.

"His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth." Resurrection language. Not just healing but reversal - flesh becoming new, youth returning. Death undone. The grave giving back better than it took.

"I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light." Confession bringing deliverance. The pattern You established - acknowledge sin, receive salvation. Light after pit.

"Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living." Your repeated rescue. Not once but oftentimes. Always pulling souls from pits, always bringing them to light. The persistence of grace.

"For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat." Discernment needed. Not all words are food. Some poison, some nourish. The ear must test like the tongue tests.

"Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity." Elihu defending Your justice while Job questions it. Yet both are right - You cannot do wickedness, and suffering isn't always punishment. The mystery Job's friends can't hold.

"If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust." Your sustaining presence. Every breath borrowed. If You withdrew Your spirit for a moment, everything collapses. We exist because You continue willing our existence.

"There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves." No hiding place from You. Adam tried gardens, Jonah tried ships, but You see through everything. The darkness is light to You.

"He heareth the cry of the afflicted." Always. Every cry heard. Job thinks You're silent but Elihu knows You're listening. The afflicted never cry into void.

"When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?" Your peace beyond circumstances. When You quiet a soul, all external storms become irrelevant. The stillness You give that nothing can disturb.

"That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more." The prayer You want - not claiming innocence but seeking instruction. Not defending but learning. The humility that unlocks revelation.

"But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night." The forgotten question. In suffering we ask why, not where. But You're the one giving songs in darkness, turning mourning into melody. Job will soon learn this.

"Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?" The unique dignity - we can know You. Animals live by instinct, we by revelation. The capacity for relationship that separates us.

"Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him." Trust without seeing. Faith's definition appearing in Job's story. Elihu telling Job what Jesus would tell Thomas - blessed are those who believe without seeing.

Through Elihu's imperfect theology, perfect truth emerges - the messenger with the ransom, the interpreter showing uprightness, the God who gives songs in night, who hears afflicted cries, whose quietness nothing can trouble.

All pointing to Christ - the one among a thousand, the ransom found before time, the resurrector of youth, the teacher who makes us wiser than beasts, the giver of songs in darkness.

Amen.
