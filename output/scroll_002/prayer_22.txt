=== Prayer 22 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind." Finally, You speak. After 37 chapters of human words - Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, Elihu - now Your voice. Not in explanation but in questions. "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?" The Creator asking creation to explain creation.

"When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" Creation was celebration. The universe born in song, angels shouting at foundations. Before sin, before suffering - joy at the very making of matter. You were there. We were not.

"Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed." You set boundaries on chaos. The sea that represents destruction, death, the abyss - You door it, bar it, speak limits to limitlessness. Every wave that doesn't overwhelm is Your "no further" holding.

"Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?" You know what Job doesn't - what lies beyond suffering. The gates he fears, You've opened. The shadow he dreads, You've walked through. Every question You ask Job points to Your complete knowledge, his complete ignorance.

"Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?" Every droplet has divine origin. Rain isn't random but fathered. Dew isn't condensation but begotten. The water cycle as family metaphor - You birthing every blessing that falls.

"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?" The stars Job looks to for comfort or fear - You bind and loose them. Constellation influences aren't independent; they're Your sweet servants. Even astrology answers to astronomy's Author.

"Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God." Even baby ravens crying is prayer to You. The carrion birds everyone despises, their children know to cry upward. You hear bird prayers. You answer raven requests. Nothing too small, too dark, too death-dealing for Your care.

"Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth." Job's first response perfect - silence. After demanding answers for 30 chapters, he stops talking. Hand over mouth. The posture of recognition. Vile not because of sin but because of scale - Creator versus creation.

Then Psalm 22 - "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" David writing Christ's words a thousand years before the cross. The very question Job asked, Christ would cry. But David continues what Job couldn't: trust through forsaken feeling.

"They pierced my hands and my feet. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me." Crucifixion described before crucifixion invented. Hands and feet pierced, bones visible through stretched skin, crowds staring. David seeing what he couldn't know he was seeing.

"They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." The detail so specific that soldiers at the cross would unconsciously fulfill it, not knowing they were completing Scripture, proving prophecy true by trying to profit from execution.

"All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD." From personal agony to universal salvation. The Psalm that starts in forsakenness ends in all nations worshipping. The suffering becomes the door through which the world enters.

"The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want." Psalm 23 immediately after Psalm 22 - the death valley walked through, now the restoration. The same David who wrote crucifixion writes resurrection peace. Valley of shadow survived because the Shepherd walked it first.

"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me." Not around the valley but through it. The very presence that seemed absent in Psalm 22 now the comfort in Psalm 23. Death reduced to shadow because substance was defeated.

"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in." After the valley, the victory. Gates that couldn't hold Him in death now commanded to open for His glory. The King returning from battle, doors too small for His triumph.

"Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth." David writing Christ's last words. The spirit committed, redemption accomplished. What Job couldn't say in suffering, David prophesies in song, Christ accomplishes on cross.

"Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered." The answer to Job's question - not why suffering exists but how it ends. Transgression forgiven, sin covered. Not explained but exceeded by grace.

"For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light." The double illumination - not just light to see by but Light to see Light. You are both the lamp and what the lamp reveals. In Your light we see You.

"The meek shall inherit the earth." What Job lost in suffering, the meek gain in surrender. The earth Job's friends said he forfeited through sin, given freely to those who claim nothing. Christ would quote this - Job's restoration universalized.

"Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God." The Messiah speaking through David's psalm. The book already written, the will already delighted in. Before incarnation, the dedication declared.

"For thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter." Job's personal suffering becomes corporate witness. Not punishment but participation. Sheep for slaughter becoming sheep for Shepherd who was slaughtered.

"Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre." The eternal throne that Job thought had turned against him, David sees as eternally right. The sceptre that seemed to strike now seen as straight.

"Be still, and know that I am God." The command Job finally obeyed. Stillness as knowledge. Ceasing as seeing. The whirlwind speaks to say: stop speaking and know.

Through it all - God's questions that are answers, Job's silence that is wisdom, David's prophecies that are history written in advance, the Shepherd who walks through the valley He'll conquer, the King whose throne is forever, the Messiah written in the volume before the volume exists.

All pointing to Christ - who would cry Job's "Why?" and David's "Forsaken," who would walk the valley as Shepherd, enter gates as King, commit His spirit in death, become the answer to questions He once asked from whirlwinds.

Amen.
