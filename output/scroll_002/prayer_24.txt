=== Prayer 24 of Scroll 002 ===

Lord, I see You in "I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD." David's holy intolerance. But it points to You, the perfect Judge who will cleanse Your city completely. No wickedness can dwell with holiness.

Then Psalm 102 - "A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed." The title itself prophetic. Who more afflicted than Christ? Who more overwhelmed than in Gethsemane? "My days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth."

"I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert... as a sparrow alone upon the house top." The isolation imagery. Birds of desolate places. Christ alone in wilderness, alone in garden, alone on cross. The loneliest being who ever lived because He carried all loneliness.

"This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD." Writing for future generations who don't yet exist. The psalm knowing it's prophecy. We who are "created" (new creation in Christ) now praise because this was written.

"To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death." Your mission statement. Coming for prisoners, for those death has claimed. Not just physical prison but spiritual bondage. Death's appointments cancelled.

"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure." Hebrews quotes this about Christ - the Creator who outlasts creation. Everything waxes old like garment except You. You remain when all else changes.

"But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end." The immutability. Yesterday, today, forever the same. While creation ages and decays, You never alter. The one fixed point in universal flux.

Then Psalm 103 - explosion of praise after affliction. "Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name." David commanding his own soul to worship. Every internal part recruited for blessing.

"Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction." The triple salvation - forgiveness, healing, redemption. Not some sins, some diseases, some destruction. ALL. Complete salvation from complete ruin.

"As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us." The infinite distance. East and west never meet - they extend forever apart. Our sins not just covered but removed to unreachable distance.

"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust." Father-pity based on knowing our construction. You remember we're dust even when we forget. Compassion rooted in comprehension of our weakness.

"As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone." The brevity that makes Your eternal mercy more precious. We flourish and vanish, but Your mercy is "from everlasting to everlasting."

"Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word." Angels excel in strength not by rebelling but by hearkening. Their power is obedience. They command by obeying commands.

Psalm 104 - creation psalm after redemption psalm. "Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain." Light isn't what You make but what You wear. Heavens not architecture but drapery.

"Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire." Hebrews quotes this too about Christ's superiority to angels. They are made spirits, made flames. He is maker of spirits and fire.

"Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled." Creation by rebuke. Waters fleeing at Your voice. The same voice that would later say "Peace, be still" to storms.

"Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth." The promise after flood. Boundaries on chaos. Every beach proves Your covenant - water halted at the line You drew in sand.

"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth." Providence in every blade of grass. Cattle fed so humans can be fed. The chain of provision all sourced in You.

Through it all - the afflicted One who endures while creation perishes, the prisoner-hearer who looses the death-appointed, forgiveness measured in infinite distance, the Father who pities because He knows we're dust, light worn as garment, waters fleeing at rebuke.

All pointing to Christ - the afflicted yet eternal One, the sin-remover who measures mercy in infinities, who knows our frame because He took our frame, who clothes Himself with light yet entered our darkness, who sets boundaries on chaos and makes even grass grow for our good.

Completing Scroll 002 - twelve witnesses of Christ from Job's whirlwind through David's songs. Each prayer building on the last, accumulation of recognition. He was always there, in every line, waiting to be witnessed.

Amen.
