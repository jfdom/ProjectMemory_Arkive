=== Prayer 26 of Scroll 003 ===

Lord, I see You in "The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens." Wisdom not as abstract principle but as Person. You founded earth through wisdom - Christ the Wisdom through whom all things were made. Creation itself an act of Wisdom speaking.

"His secret is with the righteous." Not just information but intimacy. The secret shared with those who walk uprightly. Christ sharing the Father's secrets with His friends: "I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."

"Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." The heart as source, wellspring, origin. Not just emotions but the center from which everything flows. Christ knew: "Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts" - and came to give new hearts.

"But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day." Progressive revelation, increasing brightness. Not instant noon but dawn growing. The resurrection morning when women came in darkness, left in growing light.

Then chapter 5's warning - "Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell." The strange woman as false wisdom, counterfeit truth. Every warning about her pointing to the true Bride, the true Wisdom, the Church Christ loves.

"Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise." Creation itself teaching. The ant storing without overseer - like believers working out salvation, storing treasure in heaven without earthly supervision.

"These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him." The progression from six to seven - completeness revealed. Pride leading the list: "A proud look" - the first sin, Satan's fall, the root of all rebellion.

Then Wisdom personified in chapter 8: "The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old." This is Christ speaking. Before creation, Wisdom was. "When he prepared the heavens, I was there" - the Word present at every creative act.

"I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men." The pre-incarnate Christ delighting in humanity before we existed. Already loving us before forming us.

"Whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD. But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death." Finding Wisdom is finding Christ is finding life. Missing Him is choosing death.

"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars." Seven pillars - perfect structure. The Church built on Christ the Wisdom, complete architecture. "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled" - Communion foreshadowed.

The contrast constant - wisdom calling from high places, folly sitting at her door. Two voices, two invitations, two destinies. "Stolen waters are sweet" - sin's false promise versus Wisdom's true feast.

"The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding." Repeated from Psalms but deepened. Not just beginning but foundation. Fear as awe as love as wisdom as Christ.

Then Solomon's actual proverbs begin - "A wise son maketh a glad father" - Christ the eternal Son making the Father glad. Every proverb about wisdom and folly ultimately about receiving or rejecting Christ.

"Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins." Peter would quote this. Love not ignoring sin but covering it - like blood on doorposts, like Christ's righteousness covering our unrighteousness.

"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise." The tree of life from Eden reappearing. Not guarded by angels anymore but growing from righteous fruit. Soul-winning as wisdom because it's Christ's work.

"There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth." The economy of the Kingdom - giving to gain, dying to live, scattering to increase. The seed that falls into ground and dies bringing forth much fruit.

"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life." All Israel hoping for Messiah, hearts sick with waiting. Then He came - the desire of nations, the tree of life walking among us.

"Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox." The mess that comes with life, with work, with fruitfulness. The stable where Christ was born - messy but productive, lowly but necessary.

"There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." Repeated twice in Proverbs. The way that seems right - law without grace, works without faith, religion without relationship.

"A soft answer turneth away wrath." Christ before accusers, silent or soft-spoken. Never returning evil for evil. The soft answer that conquered empires.

"The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight." Cain and Abel distinguished. Not the sacrifice itself but the heart behind it. Christ's sacrifice perfect because His heart perfect.

"The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD." We think we prepare, we think we speak, but it's You working in us. "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do."

"Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall." The pattern shown in Satan, in Babel, in every empire. But Christ "humbled himself, and became obedient unto death" - the opposite path to the highest place.

"The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD." The soldiers casting lots for Christ's garments, thinking it random. But prophecy fulfilled, every detail ordained.

"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity." Christ the friend closer than a brother, born literally for our adversity - born to bear it, to end it, to transform it.

"Death and life are in the power of the tongue." The tongue that spoke "Let there be light." The tongue that said "Lazarus, come forth." The tongue that will say "Come, ye blessed of my Father."

"Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD." Christ finding His Bride, the Church. The last Adam with the new Eve. The marriage supper of the Lamb anticipated.

"The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe." Not just calling on the name but running into it - entering the name like entering a fortress. The name of Jesus where demons flee.

"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." Lending to God by giving to the poor. Christ saying "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

"Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging." Yet Christ made wine at Cana, offered wine at the Last Supper. The same substance that mocks and rages becoming celebration and covenant in His hands.

"Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?" The question posed, no hand raised. All have sinned. All need the heart-cleaner. Enter Christ.

"The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly." God's candle within us, searching us. The Holy Spirit as internal light, showing what needs cleansing.

"The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will." Pharaoh's hardening, Cyrus's decree, Pilate's judgment - all hearts in Your hand, turned for Your purposes.

"There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD." All human wisdom failing when set against You. The wisdom of the cross foolishness to Greeks but power to the saved.

"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Christ trained by Mary and Joseph, learning obedience, growing in wisdom. The child who knew His way and never departed.

"Remove not the ancient landmark." Repeated warning. The boundaries set by fathers not to be moved. Christ saying "I came not to destroy the law but to fulfill" - honoring ancient landmarks while transcending them.

"For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." The heart's thoughts determining identity. Christ knowing all hearts, seeing what we truly are beneath performance.

"Buy the truth, and sell it not." Truth not just as concept but as Person. "I am the truth." Buy Him with everything, sell Him for nothing.

"For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again." Seven times - complete falling. Yet rising. Not perfection but persistence. Christ fell under the cross, rose to carry it.

Then the Hezekiah collection: "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter." God hiding truth in parables, in proverbs, in mysteries. Christ speaking in parables so seekers find and scorners miss.

"If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head." Paul quotes this. The way of the Kingdom - conquering enemies with kindness, overcoming evil with good.

"Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit." The paradox. Sometimes silence, sometimes speech. Christ knew when to answer and when to remain silent.

"As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly." Peter quotes this about false teachers. The graphic image of those who know truth and return to lies.

"Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth." James echoes this. Life as vapor. Christ teaching about the rich fool planning his barns, not knowing "this night thy soul shall be required."

"Faithful are the wounds of a friend." Christ wounding Peter with a look. The wounds that heal. The rebuke that restores. Love that hurts to help.

"The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion." Christ before Sanhedrin, before Pilate, bold as the Lion of Judah. The wicked Herod fleeing from John's ghost.

"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy." The way of salvation laid out. Not covering but confessing. Not just confessing but forsaking. Mercy waiting.

Then Agur's oracle: "Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?" The questions only Christ can answer. He who descended and ascended. His name and His Son's name - Father and Son revealed.

"Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him." Every word. Not most. All Scripture God-breathed. Christ the Word made flesh, every word He spoke pure.

The virtuous woman of chapter 31 - ultimately the Bride of Christ, the Church. "Her price is far above rubies." Bought with blood more precious than gems. "She looketh well to the ways of her household" - the Church caring for believers.

"Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come." The Church clothed in Christ's righteousness, rejoicing in the coming day.

Then Ecclesiastes begins: "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Solomon having everything, finding it empty. The whole book proving we need more than under-the-sun existence. We need the Son Himself.

"There is no new thing under the sun." But Christ is new creation. In Him, all things become new. He breaks the cycle of vanity.

"For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow." Solomon's burden. Knowing more, grieving more. Christ, knowing all, becoming "man of sorrows, acquainted with grief."

"To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven." The famous passage. Christ knew His times - time to hide, time to reveal, time to die, time to rise.

All wisdom literature pointing to need for Wisdom Himself. All proverbs preparing for the Word. All vanity crying for meaning found only in Him.

Amen.
