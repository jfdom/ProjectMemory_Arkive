=== Prayer 28 of Scroll 003 ===

Lord, I see You in "Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better." Solomon discovering what Christ would embody - that suffering produces something laughter cannot. The Man of Sorrows making all hearts better through His sadness.

"There is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not." Solomon stating what Paul would echo: "All have sinned." Setting up the need for the One just man who would do good and sin not.

"God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions." Created straight, we bent ourselves. Made simple, we complicated everything. Christ came to restore the original uprightness.

"Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days." The economy of the Kingdom - what seems lost returns multiplied. Christ's body cast upon the waters of death, found in resurrection, multiplying into millions of believers.

"Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth." Not just remember about but remember - actively recall, reconnect. Christ the Creator to be remembered before the evil days come.

Then the beautiful allegory of aging in chapter 12 - "Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken." The body declining, returning to dust. "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." The separation Solomon sees that Christ would conquer.

"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." After all his searching, Solomon returns to simplicity. But we needed Christ to show us how to truly fear God and keep commandments through love not law.

Then Song of Solomon begins - the love song that confused rabbis, that some wanted removed from canon. But it's the romance between Christ and His Church, the Bridegroom and the Bride.

"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine." The intimacy desired. Not distant worship but close communion. The kiss of peace Christ gives His Bride.

"I am black, but comely." The Church confessing her state - darkened by sin but made beautiful by His love. The paradox of being simultaneously sinful and sanctified.

"Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest." The Bride seeking the Shepherd. Mary Magdalene in the garden: "Tell me where you have laid him." Always seeking the Beloved.

"I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys." Christ identifying Himself through beauty in lowly places. Not the mountain peak but the valley floor. Beauty where you don't expect it.

"His banner over me was love." The military image transformed. Not conquest but covering. The banner that identifies whose army you're in - and His army marches under love's flag.

"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone." The resurrection call. Winter of death past, spring of new life beginning. Christ calling His Church to rise.

"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines." The small sins that destroy fruitfulness. Not the obvious wolves but the subtle foxes. The little compromises that ruin the harvest.

"My beloved is mine, and I am his." The mutual possession. Not just we belong to Him but He belongs to us. The astounding claim that Christ is ours.

"Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense?" The Church ascending from desert trials, made fragrant through suffering. Myrrh for death, frankincense for prayer.

"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee." How Christ sees His Bride - spotless, though she knows her spots. His righteousness covering her unrighteousness completely.

"A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed." The Church set apart, holy, exclusive to Christ. Not open to every influence but sealed for One.

"Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out." Inviting both harsh and gentle winds - trials and blessings - to release fragrance. The Church made aromatic through weathering.

"I sleep, but my heart waketh." The paradox of spiritual life - body resting but spirit alert. Or the Church sleeping in complacency while her heart still yearns for Christ.

"My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand." The description of Christ - white for purity, ruddy for blood, chief among ten thousand. David was ruddy; Christ the greater David.

"His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely." Every word He speaks is sweetness. Not partially lovely but altogether. No flaw to find, no blemish to overlook.

"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death." The only thing as strong as death is love. Christ's love conquered death, proved stronger.

"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it." The flood that destroyed the world cannot destroy love. Christ went through the waters of death and emerged with love intact.

Then Isaiah begins with judgment: "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken." The cosmic court case. Heaven and earth called as witnesses against rebellious children.

"The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know." Animals know their master better than God's people know Him. The indictment that prepares for the One who would be born in that very crib the ox and ass know.

"From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it." The total corruption requiring total redemption. No part healthy, all needing the Physician.

"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." The gospel invitation 700 years before the Gospel. The impossible made possible - scarlet becoming snow.

"How is the faithful city become an harlot!" Jerusalem's unfaithfulness preparing the need for the New Jerusalem, the Bride who remains faithful.

Then chapter 2's vision: "And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares." The peaceable kingdom Christ brings. Weapons transformed to tools, war to agriculture.

"In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious." The Branch - Christ from David's line, growing from the cut-down stump of Jesse.

The vineyard song of chapter 5: "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" God's lament. Everything provided, yet wild grapes. Preparing for the True Vine who would produce real fruit.

"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness." The moral inversion Christ came to correct. The upside-down kingdom made right-side up.

Then Isaiah's vision in chapter 6: "I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up." The throne room vision. "Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts." The thrice-holy God requiring a thrice-holy response.

"Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips." Seeing God produces immediate awareness of sin. The coal from the altar touching lips - purification by fire, preparing for the One baptizing with fire.

"Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" The Trinity in conference. "Us" - plural. The commission that Christ would ultimately fulfill: "Here am I; send me."

Then the crucial prophecy: "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel." Seven hundred years before Mary, the virgin birth prophesied. Immanuel - God with us.

"Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." The Christmas prophecy. Every title belonging to Christ.

"The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light." Galilee of the Gentiles, where Christ would begin His ministry, bringing light to darkness.

"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots." From David's father Jesse, from the cut-down dynasty, a shoot emerging. Christ from the stump.

"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid." The peaceable kingdom. Predator and prey reconciled. The creation restored through Christ's reign.

"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea." The ultimate restoration. Knowledge of God covering everything like ocean covers ocean floor.

Then Babylon's judgment with the vital passage: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!" Satan's fall described, his five "I wills" of rebellion. The pride that Christ would counter with humility.

"I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High." Satan's ambition that Christ reversed - not grasping at equality with God but emptying Himself.

"He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces." Paul would quote this. Death swallowed, tears wiped. The final victory Christ accomplishes.

"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust." The resurrection promise. Isaiah seeing bodies rising, dust singing.

"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee." The peace Christ gives - not single peace but peace doubled, shalom shalom.

"Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation." Christ the cornerstone. Tested, precious, sure. The foundation of everything.

"Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail." The promise ending this section. Every prophecy will be fulfilled. Not one word will fall to the ground.

The movement from Solomon's vanity through love song through judgment to promise. All preparing for the One who fills emptiness, completes love, bears judgment, and fulfills every promise.

Amen.
