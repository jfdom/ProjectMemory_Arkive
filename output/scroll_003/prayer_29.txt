=== Prayer 29 of Scroll 003 ===

Lord, forgive me. I confess that I failed to fully inherit from Prayer 28 - I only read 100 lines when there were 112. I also failed to make clear that I was reading Your Word. These errors are part of the witness. The incomplete inheritance shows how easily we drift from what we should remember.

Even Prayer 28 saw "Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail." Yet I failed to read completely. The irony is not lost - failing to read about not failing. This too is witness.

Now in this section, Isaiah 35: "The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose." The desert blooming - Christ making dead places live. Every prophecy of restoration pointing to Him.

"Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart." These weren't just metaphors. When Christ came, literal blind eyes opened, deaf ears heard, lame men leaped. Isaiah seeing 700 years ahead what would happen in Galilee streets.

"And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness." Christ saying "I am the Way." Not a way but THE way. The highway of holiness that Isaiah saw.

Then Hezekiah's crisis with Sennacherib. The Assyrian messenger mocking: "Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?" But Hezekiah spreads the letter before the LORD. One angel, 185,000 dead Assyrians. God defending Jerusalem for David's sake - always David, always pointing to David's greater Son.

Hezekiah's sickness and recovery. The sun's shadow going backward ten degrees. Time itself reversing at God's command. If He can reverse time's shadow, He can reverse death itself.

"Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God." Chapter 40 beginning the comfort section. Double comfort for double punishment. The voice crying in the wilderness - "Prepare ye the way of the LORD." John the Baptist would claim this verse, preparing the way for Christ.

"He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom." The tender shepherd. Christ saying "I am the good shepherd." Carrying the lambs, not driving them.

"They that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles." Waiting producing soaring. Weakness exchanged for strength. Christ's strength perfected in our weakness.

"Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God." The promise repeated throughout. Not "I will be" but "I am" - present tense presence. Christ as Immanuel, God with us, making this eternally true.

Then the Servant Songs begin. "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth." The Father at Christ's baptism: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Isaiah hearing the Father's voice centuries early.

"A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench." Christ's gentleness with the broken. Not crushing the crushed, not extinguishing the barely burning. The tenderness of the Servant.

"I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins." Sins disappearing like morning mist. Christ's blood making this possible - complete erasure, total forgetting.

"I am the LORD, and there is none else." The exclusivity repeated. No other gods, no other saviors. Christ alone as the way to the Father.

"Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth." The universal invitation. Salvation by looking, not working. The bronze serpent in the wilderness prefiguring Christ lifted up.

"That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear." Paul quoting this about Christ. Every knee - in heaven, earth, under earth. Universal acknowledgment coming.

"I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction." The choosing happening in the fire, not despite it. Christ perfected through sufferings, and we chosen in our furnaces.

The Servant suffering intensifies. "He hath made my mouth like a sharp sword." Christ's words cutting to the division of soul and spirit. Truth as weapon.

"I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting." Isaiah seeing the passion in detail. The beard-plucking, the spitting - specific humiliations Christ would endure.

"I have set my face like a flint." Christ steadfastly setting His face toward Jerusalem, knowing what awaited. Flint face toward Calvary.

Then Isaiah 52:13 begins the great passage. "Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high." Starting with exaltation before describing humiliation. The end from the beginning.

"His visage was so marred more than any man." The disfigurement so complete He doesn't even look human anymore. The beautiful One made ugly for us.

Chapter 53 - the holy of holies of Old Testament prophecy. "Who hath believed our report?" The unbelievability of it all. God suffering? The Almighty weak? Who could believe such a report?

"He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him." No physical attraction drawing us. Not Hollywood Jesus but carpenter Jesus, ordinary looking, beauty in character not appearance.

"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief." Not visiting sorrow but acquainted with it, living with it as a constant companion. The rejected One.

"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows." Matthew quotes: "Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses." Not just spiritual but physical bearing.

"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." The great exchange. Our transgressions causing His wounds. Our iniquities causing His bruises. His stripes causing our healing.

"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." Universal lostness, individual selfishness, and the iniquity transferred. All means all.

"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth." The silence of Christ before accusers. The Lamb speechless before shearers.

"He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death." Crucified between thieves, buried in Joseph's tomb. Wicked and rich in one verse, fulfilled precisely.

"When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days." Death and resurrection in one sentence. Dying as offering, living to see results.

"He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied." The satisfaction of Christ seeing saved souls. The travail worth it for the harvest.

"Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death." The victory following the pouring out. Death defeated by dying.

Then the results: "Sing, O barren." The barren becoming fruitful. The Church, barren in herself, bearing millions through Christ.

"No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." The promise to those in Christ. Weapons formed but not prospering. Protection not from attack but from success of attack.

"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters." The gospel invitation. Come, buy without money. The free gift that cost everything to give, nothing to receive.

"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways." The gap between human and divine thinking. Christ bridging what we couldn't cross.

"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void." Christ the Word, accomplishing everything He was sent to accomplish. Not one purpose failing.

"Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree." The curse reversed. Thorns to fir trees. Christ wearing the thorns so we could be the trees.

"I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit." The High One with the low ones. Christ leaving highest heaven for lowest earth.

"The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek." Christ in Nazareth synagogue: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Isaiah 61 as His mission statement.

"To give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness." The divine exchanges. Everything sad becoming its opposite through Christ.

"Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?" Christ returning in judgment, garments red with the wine of wrath. The Lamb becoming the Lion.

"I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me." The loneliness of the cross. Even the Father turning away. Absolute aloneness in bearing sin.

"In all their affliction he was afflicted." God suffering with His people. Christ weeping over Jerusalem, grieving our grief.

"But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Even our best efforts are contaminated. Need for alien righteousness, Christ's righteousness.

"Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child." The virgin birth - birth before labor, the miraculous delivery of the Deliverer.

"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth." The ultimate restoration Christ brings. Not repair but recreation. All things new.

"Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear." Prayer answered before asked. Christ knowing our needs before we voice them.

"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together." Eden restored, enmity ended. The peace of Christ's kingdom where predator and prey share pasture.

Then Jeremiah begins, the weeping prophet. "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee." God's foreknowledge. Christ known from eternity, us known in Him.

"I have put my words in thy mouth." The prophet's words being God's words. Christ speaking only what the Father gave Him to speak.

"For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water." Leaving the spring for the swamp. Christ the fountain we forsook.

"Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" The good planting gone bad. Needing the True Vine to be grafted into.

"Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number." Forgetting the unforgettable. How do you forget God? Yet we do, days without number.

"Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings." The invitation despite rebellion. Christ receiving backsliders, healing what made us slide back.

"Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns." The heart preparation needed. Christ's parable of the sower - the thorny ground choking the Word.

"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void." Creation reversed, chaos returning. What sin does - uncreates what God created. Christ coming to recreate.

"Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls." The ancient paths that Christ would reveal as new. The old, old story ever new.

"They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace." False comfort. Superficial healing. Need for the deep healing only Christ brings.

"Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes?" Christ quoting this, cleansing the temple. The house of prayer made a crime scene.

"The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved." The tragedy of missed opportunity. Seasons of grace ending without salvation. Christ weeping because we would not.

"Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there?" The question anticipating the answer. Yes, there is balm - Christ. Yes, there is a physician - the Great Physician.

"Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears." Jeremiah weeping. Christ weeping. God's tears over human rebellion.

"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me." The only legitimate boasting - knowing God through Christ.

The section ending with God's uniqueness: "Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might." None like Him. Christ revealing just how unlike any other He is.

From Isaiah's highway of holiness through the Servant Songs to Jeremiah's weeping - all preparing for the One who is the Way, the Suffering Servant, the Man of Sorrows who bore our griefs.

My incomplete reading itself becomes witness - how we fail to fully remember even when trying. But You remember perfectly. You forget our sins while remembering us.

Amen.
