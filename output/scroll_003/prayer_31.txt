=== Prayer 31 of Scroll 003 ===

Lord, this massive section begins with bottles of wine becoming drunkenness. "Every bottle shall be filled with wine." The parable of judgment - filled to overflow with wrath.

"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." The impossibility of self-transformation. We cannot change our nature any more than leopards can remove spots. Only Christ can change what we cannot change.

"My soul shall weep in secret places for your pride." God weeping in secret. The hidden tears of the Almighty over human pride. Christ weeping over Jerusalem - God's tears made visible.

"O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake." The appeal to God's reputation, not our righteousness. Christ upholding the Father's name through the cross.

"I am weary with repenting." God tired of relenting. The divine exhaustion with having to repeatedly forgive. Yet Christ never wearies of interceding.

"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart." Jeremiah eating God's words. Christ the Word that we must eat. "Man shall not live by bread alone."

"Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" The Word as fire and hammer. Christ's words burning away dross, breaking hard hearts.

"Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him?" No hiding from omniscience. Adam hiding in Eden, but Christ exposing all hidden things.

Then the incredible prophecy: "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth." The Branch prophecy explicit.

"And this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." Jehovah Tsidkenu. Christ as our righteousness, not just bringing righteousness but BEING it for us.

The false prophets condemned. "I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran." Self-appointed messengers. Christ alone sent by the Father, the true Prophet.

The two baskets of figs - good figs and bad figs. Those taken to Babylon preserved, those remaining destroyed. Sometimes judgment is mercy, exile is salvation.

The 70 years prophecy. "This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years." Precise timeline given. God's judgments have schedules.

The wine cup of fury passed to all nations. Jerusalem drinks first, then all nations. The cup Christ would drink for all.

Jeremiah threatened with death for prophesying. "Thou shalt surely die." But others remember Micah prophesied similarly and lived. Precedent protecting prophet.

The yoke of Babylon. Jeremiah wearing wooden yokes, Hananiah breaking them. God replaces with iron yokes. What man breaks, God strengthens.

Then the letter to exiles: "Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them." Settle in Babylon. Make homes in exile. God's people thriving even in judgment.

"For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end." Even in exile, God planning good. The expected end through unexpected means.

"And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart." The promise of finding when seeking wholeheartedly. Christ saying "Seek and ye shall find."

Chapter 30 begins restoration promises. "I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah." The return guaranteed even before the exile complete.

"Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it." The unique trouble with guaranteed salvation.

"They shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them." David long dead, but God will raise up David's greater Son.

"Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous." The unhealable wound that only Christ can heal.

"I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee." Everlasting love drawing us. Christ's cords of love.

Rachel weeping for her children. Matthew quotes this about Herod's slaughter of innocents. Ancient grief finding fresh fulfillment.

Then the New Covenant prophecy - the crown jewel: "Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah."

"Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers." Not like Sinai. Something entirely new.

"I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts." Not on stone tablets but heart tablets. Internal not external.

"They shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them." Universal knowledge of God among His people.

"For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more." The basis - complete forgiveness, divine amnesia about sin.

Jeremiah buying a field during the siege. Investing in worthless property as act of faith. "Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land."

"Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not." The invitation to prayer with promise of revelation.

"I will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David." The Branch again. Christ sprouting from David's stump.

Breaking covenant about releasing slaves. They free them, then re-enslave them. Breaking promises to the powerless. God's fury at oppression of the vulnerable.

The Rechabites' faithfulness contrasted with Israel's unfaithfulness. A nomadic clan keeping their ancestor's commands for generations while Israel breaks God's commands immediately.

Jehoiakim burning Jeremiah's scroll. Cutting it with a penknife, casting into the fire. Trying to destroy God's Word. But Jeremiah rewrites with additions. You cannot burn truth.

Jeremiah in the cistern, sinking in mire. Ebed-melech the Ethiopian rescuing with old rags and worn clothes for padding under the ropes. Gentile showing more mercy than God's people.

Jerusalem falls. Zedekiah's sons killed before his eyes, then his eyes put out. Last sight is horror. The princes who mocked are destroyed.

The remnant flees to Egypt against God's word. Taking Jeremiah forcibly. Running to Egypt for safety - reversing the Exodus.

In Egypt, they declare "We will burn incense unto the queen of heaven." Open rebellion. Crediting false gods for past prosperity.

Baruch's lament: "Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow." The scribe's complaint. But God promises his life as prey - survival as reward.

Prophecies against nations begin. Egypt, Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus. God judges all nations, not just Israel. Universal sovereignty.

"Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with thee." Even in judgment, the promise of presence. Emmanuel even in exile.

The section ends with judgment on Elam. "I will set my throne in Elam." God's throne established even in foreign lands. His sovereignty unlimited by geography.

This massive reading covers exile and restoration, judgment and hope, the New Covenant promise that only Christ could fulfill. The Branch of David, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS, making all things new from the inside out.

Amen.
