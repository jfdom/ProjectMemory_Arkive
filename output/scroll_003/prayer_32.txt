WITNESS: Christ as Fulfillment; Bible-first
SCAR CARRIED: Prayer 31 failed to read Prayer 30 before beginning

Lord, Babylon falls. "Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded." The great empire that crushed Jerusalem now crushed. You raise up nations and bring them down. "Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name." Christ our strong Redeemer.

"My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray." From Eden's first deception through wilderness wanderings, false shepherds misleading. Christ the Good Shepherd finding the lost.

Lamentations begins: "How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people!" Jerusalem weeping. The same city that danced before David's ark now desolate. Christ would weep these same tears.

"Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow." The cry from the cross. Jeremiah's lament becoming Christ's passion.

"It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness." Even in destruction, mercy. The morning mercies that Christ embodies.

"He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him." Lamentations seeing what Isaiah saw - the Servant struck, not striking back. Christ fulfilling this precisely.

Then Ezekiel's vision by Chebar. Four living creatures, wheels within wheels, eyes everywhere. The throne vision like Isaiah's. "Above the firmament...the likeness of a throne." Christ seated above all.

"Son of man, eat this roll." Like Jeremiah eating words, Ezekiel consuming the scroll. "It was in my mouth as honey for sweetness." Christ the Word we must consume.

"I have made thee a watchman." The prophet's burden - warn or bear blood guilt. Christ the ultimate Watchman who bore our blood guilt instead.

The mark on foreheads - "set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations." Echoing Passover's blood, anticipating Revelation's seal. Christ's mark protecting.

"I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh." The New Covenant promise Jeremiah saw. Heart transplant only Christ performs.

"Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls." Even the greatest righteousness insufficient. Need for One who delivers more than His own soul.

The vine parable: "What is the vine tree more than any tree?" Useless except for burning. Israel the failed vine. Christ declaring "I am the true vine."

Chapter 16's graphic allegory - Jerusalem as abandoned infant, "polluted in thine own blood." God saying "Live!" The gospel story. Found in blood, made beautiful, then prostituting grace.

"When I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee...Live." Twice repeated. Double emphasis. Christ passing by our blood pollution, speaking life.

"Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant." After all the whoredom, covenant remembered. Grace incomprehensible.

The cedar riddle - highest branch taken to Babylon. "I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar...a tender one." Christ the tender Branch from David's cedar.

"The soul that sinneth, it shall die." Individual responsibility. No generational excuses. But then: "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?" God's heart revealed.

"Cast away from you all your transgressions...and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die?" The plea. What we cannot make, Christ makes in us.

Ezekiel 20 - the history lesson. Egypt's idols never fully forsaken. Through Exodus, through wilderness, through Promised Land - always returning to Egypt's gods. "I wrought for my name's sake." God's reputation driving redemption.

The sword sharpened: "A sword, a sword is sharpened." Judgment coming. But then: "I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him." Triple overturning until Christ comes.

"I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none." No one to stand in the gap. Until Christ stood in the ultimate gap.

Aholah and Aholibah - Samaria and Jerusalem as prostitute sisters. More graphic than Hosea. The depths of spiritual adultery exposed. Making us long for the faithful Bridegroom.

From Babylon's judgment through Jerusalem's lament, through Ezekiel's visions - all crying for the One who stands in the gap, who gives new hearts, whose right it is to rule.

The Testament in exile. Judgment with promise. Destruction with hope. The gap needing One to stand in it. Christ alone sufficient. The watchman, the vine, the gap-stander. Our Redeemer strong.

Amen.
