Lord, the company stones them with stones. The judgment complete. "They shall know that I am the Lord GOD." Every judgment ending with this refrain - that they might know You. Christ making God known through judgment and mercy.

The pot set on the fire, Jerusalem as the bloody city. "Woe to the bloody city!" The scum that won't come out, the filthiness that resists purging. Until Christ's blood purges what no fire could cleanse.

Then Ezekiel's wife dies - "the desire of thine eyes with a stroke." He cannot mourn. A sign to the people. When the temple falls, they too will be unable to mourn properly. Christ weeping when we cannot, mourning what we're too numb to grieve.

"I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength." The unthinkable - God profaning His own sanctuary. Like Christ becoming sin who knew no sin. The holy becoming unholy for our sake.

Ezekiel becoming mute until the escapee arrives with news. The prophet silenced. Christ silent before accusers, speaking only when the Father gives words.

Against the Ammonites who said "Aha" when the sanctuary was profaned. Those who rejoice at God's people's pain. "They shall know that I am the LORD." Christ will vindicate His people against all who mock.

Against Moab who said Judah is "like unto all the heathen." Denying Israel's uniqueness. But Christ proves Israel unique - salvation is of the Jews, through Abraham's seed all nations blessed.

Against Edom for ancient hatred, taking vengeance. Esau's descendants still hating Jacob's. The old hatred that only Christ's love can overcome.

Against the Philistines, the perpetual enemies from David's time. "I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes." The vengeance only God can take, that Christ will execute at His return.

Then Tyre's judgment begins. The great merchant city rejoicing at Jerusalem's fall - "I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste." Profiting from others' destruction. Christ overturning the merchants' tables, condemning those who profit from holy things.

"I will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up." Wave after wave of judgment. Tyre the impregnable made "like the top of a rock" for spreading nets.

Nebuchadnezzar coming as "king of kings from the north." Only One is truly King of kings. Every earthly king of kings pointing to Christ's ultimate sovereignty.

"I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard." The music stopping. Like Babylon in Revelation - the voice of harpers heard no more. Christ bringing the final silence to worldly celebration.

The princes of the sea trembling, coming down from their thrones. "They shall clothe themselves with trembling." When Christ returns, every throne trembles, every crown cast down.

"When I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee." The deep that Genesis 1 describes, that Noah's flood released. The chaos waters that only Christ walks upon.

"I shall set glory in the land of the living." After judgment, glory. After destruction, restoration. Christ bringing glory to the land of the living through His resurrection.

Tyre will be sought but never found again. Complete erasure. Yet Christ seeks and finds the lost, reversing the irreversible.

This shorter section still full of judgment becoming gospel. Every "they shall know that I am the LORD" pointing to Christ making the Father known. The bloody city needing blood to cleanse it. The sanctuary profaned so we could be made holy.

From Eden where the first blood was shed, through David fighting Philistines, through Isaiah and Jeremiah's prophecies - all converging here in Ezekiel's visions of judgment that prepare for the coming Judge who first comes to be judged.

Amen.
