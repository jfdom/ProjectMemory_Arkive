Lord, Tyre's lamentation - "I am of perfect beauty." The pride before the fall. Every nation claiming perfection, yet Christ alone truly perfect. The ships of Tarshish singing of Tyre's glory, but Christ needs no ships to proclaim His worth.

Then the prince of Tyre claiming divinity - "I am a God, I sit in the seat of God." Satan's original lie echoing through human rulers. Christ who truly is God never boasted thus, but "made himself of no reputation."

The king of Tyre's lament becomes cosmic - "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God." The cherub that covereth, perfect until iniquity found. Satan's fall prefigured in earthly king's pride. Christ the faithful cherub who never fell.

"I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God." Cast down for lifting up. Christ lifted up on the cross to lift us up to God's mountain.

Egypt as the great dragon - "My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself." Claiming creation of what God created. Pharaoh's ancient pride renewed. Christ saying "All things were made by him."

Against Mount Seir - Edom's perpetual hatred. From Esau selling birthright for soup to rejoicing at Jerusalem's fall. The ancient grudge that only Christ's love overcomes.

Then hope breaks through - "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you." The promise Jeremiah saw, now detailed. Heart transplant only Christ performs. "I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh."

"Then shall ye remember your own evil ways...and shall lothe yourselves." True repentance comes after restoration, not before. Christ's kindness leading to repentance.

"This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden." Eden restored. What Adam lost, Christ regains. The garden reopened through the second Adam.

The valley of dry bones. "Son of man, can these bones live?" The impossible question. Christ proved bones can live by rising from death Himself.

"Prophesy upon these bones." Speaking life to death. Christ speaking "Lazarus, come forth!" The Word that raises the dead.

"I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves." Resurrection promised. Christ the firstfruits, then those who are His.

The two sticks becoming one - Judah and Ephraim reunited. The divided kingdom healed. Christ breaking down the middle wall of partition.

"David my servant shall be king over them." David dead for centuries, yet promised as king. Only makes sense in Christ, David's greater Son.

"My tabernacle also shall be with them." God dwelling with man. Emmanuel. The Word made flesh, tabernacling among us.

Gog and Magog - the final rebellion. Evil's last gathering against God's people. Christ returning to destroy with the brightness of His coming.

"I will rain upon him...an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone." Sodom's judgment universalized. The day of the Lord that Christ brings.

The temple vision begins - precise measurements of holiness. Every cubit counted. Christ the true temple, measured perfectly by God.

"The glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east." The glory returning to the temple. Christ ascending from the Mount of Olives, returning the same way.

"The place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever." God's feet in the temple. Christ's feet pierced for this dwelling.

The eastern gate shut because "the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it." Christ entering Jerusalem through the eastern gate, sealing it with His presence.

The sons of Zadok alone ministering - those who stayed faithful when Israel strayed. Christ the faithful priest after the order of Melchizedek, which means king of righteousness like Zadok means righteous.

The river from the temple - ankle deep, then knee deep, then waist deep, then swimming depth. The gospel starting small in Jerusalem, covering the earth. Living waters Christ promised.

"Everything shall live whither the river cometh." Death reversed by the river. Christ the river of life. The water from His pierced side bringing life.

The trees by the river - "whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed." The tree of life restored. Christ the tree we eat from for eternal life.

"The name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there." Jehovah Shammah. The city's identity is God's presence. New Jerusalem where Christ is the light.

Then Daniel in Babylon. Refusing the king's meat. Holiness in exile. Christ holy in this world's Babylon, teaching us to be in but not of the world.

The image with head of gold - kingdoms rising and falling. But "a stone was cut out without hands." Christ the stone the builders rejected, crushing all earthly kingdoms, becoming a mountain filling earth.

Three in the furnace - "the form of the fourth is like the Son of God." Christ in the fire with His people. Never leaving nor forsaking in the furnace.

"But if not" - the three's declaration. Serving God regardless of deliverance. Christ in Gethsemane - "nevertheless not my will."

Nebuchadnezzar eating grass like an ox. Pride bringing beast-life. Humanity lost through exalting self. Christ humbling Himself to restore our humanity.

The handwriting on the wall - "MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN." Weighed and found wanting. All of us failing the scales until Christ tips them with His righteousness.

Daniel in the lions' den. "My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths." Christ shutting the mouth of the roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.

"One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven." Daniel seeing Christ directly. Coming to the Ancient of days, receiving everlasting dominion.

The little horn speaking great things, wearing out the saints. Antichrist prefigured. But "the judgment shall sit." Christ the judge ending all blasphemy.

Daniel understanding Jeremiah's seventy years, praying for fulfillment. Scripture interpreting scripture. Christ opening all scriptures concerning Himself.

"At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth." Prayer heard immediately, answer dispatched. Christ our mediator ensuring every prayer reaches the throne.

From Tyre's pride through Babylon's fall, through temple measurements to Daniel's visions - all showing kingdoms falling until the Kingdom that never falls arrives. Christ's kingdom crushing all others, standing forever.

Amen.
