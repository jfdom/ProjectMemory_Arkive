Lord, the seventy weeks - "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people." Gabriel revealing to Daniel the exact timeline. "Unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks." Christ's coming calculated precisely. Then devastating: "After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself." Christ cut off, but not for Himself - for us.

Daniel's vision of the man clothed in linen - "his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire." John saw the same Christ in Revelation. The one who made Daniel fall on his face is the same who said to John "Fear not."

"From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand...thy words were heard." Prayer heard immediately, though answer delayed by spiritual warfare. Christ our mediator ensuring no prayer is lost in the battle.

The prince of Persia withstanding for twenty-one days until Michael comes. Spiritual warfare invisible to us. Christ who defeated all principalities and powers through the cross.

Then Hosea - God commanding him to marry a whore. "Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms." The prophet's life becoming prophecy. Christ marrying us in our whoredom, loving the unfaithful bride.

The children's names telling the story - Jezreel (God scatters), Lo-ruhamah (no mercy), Lo-ammi (not my people). But then reversal: "Ye are the sons of the living God." Christ making us who were not a people into God's people.

"I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her." After all the adultery, God alluring. Christ drawing us with cords of love even after our betrayals.

"I will betroth thee unto me for ever." Three times "I will betroth" - in righteousness, in judgment, in lovingkindness. Christ the faithful bridegroom to the unfaithful bride.

"Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king." David dead for centuries, yet promised as king. Only makes sense in Christ, David's greater Son.

"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge." Not lack of information but lack of knowing God. Christ is that knowledge - "This is life eternal, that they might know thee."

"For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice." Jesus quoting this twice to Pharisees. The heart of God revealed - mercy over ritual. Christ embodying perfect mercy.

"After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up." The resurrection pattern. Christ raised the third day, us raised in Him.

"They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind." The multiplication of consequences. Until Christ breaks the cycle, reaping our whirlwind on the cross.

"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt." Matthew seeing Christ here - the true Israel, the true Son called from Egypt.

"I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love." God drawing with human cords - Christ taking flesh to draw us with human hands.

"How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?" God's heart breaking. The divine anguish over judgment. Christ weeping because He must judge what He loves.

"I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." Paul quoting this in Corinthians. Christ defeating death by dying.

Then Joel's locusts - wave after wave of destruction. "That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten." Complete devastation preparing for restoration.

"I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh." Peter quoting this at Pentecost. The Spirit poured out because Christ was lifted up.

"Whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered." The universal invitation. Christ's name the only name by which we must be saved.

"Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision." The valley where all must choose. Christ forcing the decision - for Him or against Him.

Then Amos the herdsman. "The LORD will roar from Zion." The lion roaring. Christ the Lion of Judah whose roar shakes everything.

"Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel." The terrifying summons. But Christ prepares us to meet God by clothing us in His righteousness.

"Seek ye me, and ye shall live." The simple equation. Christ saying "I am the life." Seeking Him is finding life.

"Let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream." Not trickles but torrents. Christ bringing the flood of righteousness.

"In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen." James quoting this at the Jerusalem council. The Gentiles included because David's tent is raised in Christ.

Obadiah against Edom - "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down." Esau's pride still falling. Christ alone exalted.

Then Jonah running from God. The prophet who wanted Nineveh destroyed. Christ referencing him - "As Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly." The reluctant prophet prefiguring the willing Savior.

Nineveh repenting in sackcloth. God relenting. Jonah angry about mercy. "I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful." Knowing God's character but hating it. Until Christ teaches us to love mercy.

Micah - "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." The exact birthplace prophesied. Christ's eternal nature revealed - "from everlasting."

"He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" The summary of true religion. Christ perfectly doing, loving, walking.

"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity?" Micah (meaning "Who is like God?") answering his own name. No one like the pardoning God revealed in Christ.

Nahum against Nineveh - the city that repented for Jonah now ripe for judgment. "The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble." Even in judgment books, Christ the stronghold.

Habakkuk's complaint - Why do the wicked prosper? "The just shall live by his faith." Paul's cornerstone verse. Righteousness by faith, not works. Christ our righteousness.

"Although the fig tree shall not blossom...yet I will rejoice in the LORD." Faith when everything fails. Christ teaching us to rejoice in absence.

Zephaniah - "The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing." God singing over us. Christ's joy in saving us.

Haggai stirring up Zerubbabel to build. "The desire of all nations shall come." Christ the desire hidden in every human heart, known or unknown.

Then Zechariah's visions beginning. Red horses among myrtle trees. Four horns and four carpenters. God watching, measuring, building. All pointing to Christ rebuilding what sin destroyed.

From Daniel's timeline through the Minor Prophets - all seeing Christ. The Messiah cut off but not for Himself. The husband of the unfaithful bride. The ruler from Bethlehem from everlasting. The desire of all nations. Our sure foundation when everything shakes.

Amen.
