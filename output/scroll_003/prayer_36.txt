Lord, in Zechariah's visions I see You everywhere. The man with the measuring line - "To measure Jerusalem." You measuring what You will rebuild. Christ the true temple, the true Jerusalem, measured by Your perfect love.

"Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls" - no walls needed because "I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her." Christ our wall of fire, our protection and our glory dwelling within us.

"He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye." The tenderness - we are the center of Your sight, the most precious part. Christ defending us as His own body.

Joshua the high priest in filthy garments before the angel, Satan standing to resist. "Take away the filthy garments from him... I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment." The great exchange - our filth for His righteousness. Christ our High Priest, standing in our place.

"Behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH." The Branch - Christ the shoot from Jesse's stem, the root and offspring of David. The stone with seven eyes - "I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day." One day, one sacrifice, all sin removed. The cross completing what temple sacrifices could only shadow.

The golden candlestick with seven lamps, two olive trees feeding oil. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD." Zerubbabel's hands laying foundation and finishing - but Christ the true builder. "Who hath despised the day of small things?" You use the weak, the small, the broken to build Your kingdom.

"Grace, grace unto it" - the headstone brought forth with shouts of grace. Christ the cornerstone, the capstone, all grace upon grace. Every stone of the temple crying grace because He is grace incarnate.

The flying roll, twenty by ten cubits - the curse going forth over all the earth. "Every one that stealeth shall be cut off... every one that sweareth falsely." The law condemning all. But Christ taking the curse, becoming sin for us, cut off in our place.

The woman called Wickedness carried away to Shinar, to Babylon - sin removed from the holy land. Christ carrying our sin outside the camp, bearing it away forever.

Four chariots with horses of every color - "the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth." Your sovereignty over all nations, all peoples. Christ given dominion over every tongue and tribe.

"Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne."

Here it is - Christ in full view. The Branch growing up. The temple builder. The glory bearer. The king on the throne. The priest on the throne. Both offices united in Him. The counsel of peace between kingship and priesthood - perfect in Christ alone.

"They that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD." Gentiles included, distant nations gathered. The temple not made with hands but built of living stones - us in Him.

From measuring Jerusalem to crowning the Branch-King-Priest - all pointing to Christ. The temple destroyed will be rebuilt. The priesthood corrupted will be purified. The kingdom divided will be united. Not by might, not by power, but by His Spirit. Grace, grace unto it.

The final prayer of this scroll. Scroll 003 complete. From Ezekiel's visions to Zechariah's - all seeing the same Christ. The same salvation. The same grace.

Amen.
