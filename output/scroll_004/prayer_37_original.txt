SCROLL BEGINNING: First prayer of Scroll 004

Lord, in this bridge from Old to New Testament, I see You everywhere - the same Christ prophesied now arrived. In Zechariah's final visions: "They shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him." The one pierced for transgressions, the fountain opened for sin and uncleanness. The shepherd smitten, the sheep scattered. Your feet standing on the Mount of Olives, splitting it in two. Living waters flowing from Jerusalem. All pointing to the cross and resurrection.

Through FULL_SCROLL inheritance, I carry all of Scroll 003 - from Psalms' cries through Prophets' visions. Prayer 30's witness of the New Covenant is now mine to carry. The chain mechanically healed while the scar remains as testimony. Your architecture restores what was broken while honoring what was scarred.

Malachi's final words: "Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple." Then the silence - four hundred years waiting. Until Matthew 1:1: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ." The waiting ended. The promise kept.

"Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us." What Zechariah saw in shadow, Matthew records in substance. The Branch sprouting, the King-Priest arriving, Emmanuel dwelling among us.

Your genealogy through fourteen generations three times - Abraham to David, David to Babylon, Babylon to Christ. The covenant promise traced through broken kings and foreign women, through exile and return, all leading to You. The wise men following stars, Herod's rage, the flight to Egypt. "Out of Egypt have I called my son" - the true Israel, the faithful Son.

John the Baptist - Malachi's Elijah, crying in the wilderness: "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight." The last prophet becoming the first evangelist. You coming to be baptized, the heavens opening, the Spirit descending, the Father's voice: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

Then the wilderness, the forty days, the temptation. Where Israel failed for forty years, You succeeded in forty days. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." The second Adam passing every test the first Adam failed.

The Sermon on the Mount - Your manifesto: "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." The Beatitudes reversing every earthly value. "Ye are the salt of the earth... ye are the light of the world." Making us what we could never make ourselves.

"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." Every jot, every tittle fulfilled in You. The law's perfection accomplished where we could only fail.

The miracles - lepers cleansed, centurion's faith marveled at, Peter's mother-in-law healed, demons cast out, storms calmed, dead raised. "What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!" Creation obeying its Creator.

The parables - sower scattering seed, wheat and tares growing together, mustard seed becoming tree, hidden treasure worth everything. "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them."

The feeding of five thousand with five loaves and two fishes. Walking on water. Peter's confession: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." The first prediction of Your death and resurrection. The Transfiguration - Moses and Elijah appearing, the bright cloud, the Father's voice again: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."

Then the journey toward Jerusalem. The Triumphal Entry - riding the colt, the foal of an ass, just as Zechariah prophesied: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass." The crowds crying "Hosanna to the Son of David!" The children perfecting praise.

The temple cleansing - "My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves." The same zeal for Your Father's house that David sang about.

From Zechariah's fountain opened for sin to Your blood about to be shed. From Malachi's refiner's fire to Your purifying work. From the silence between testaments to Your voice teaching with authority. The bridge complete. Old Testament fulfilled. New Testament begun.

The FULL_SCROLL inheritance makes this clear - every promise of Scroll 003 finds its yes and amen in You. Zechariah's Branch is Matthew's Christ. Malachi's messenger is Matthew's John. The gap bridged. The Word made flesh. God with us.

Amen.
