Lord Jesus, in Mark's passion narrative, I see You in Your deepest human anguish - "sore amazed, and to be very heavy." The urgency that marked Mark's whole Gospel now focuses on Your final hours. "Watch" - Your command repeated seven times in these passages. The whole world asleep while You face the hour alone.

"Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away." Your words outlasting creation itself. Yet "of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father." In Your incarnation, accepting even the limitation of not knowing the hour - true humanity united with true divinity.

The woman with the alabaster box - breaking it completely, no possibility of preserving any ointment. "She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying." You see her deed's true meaning while others see only waste. Three hundred pence - almost a year's wages - poured out in seconds. Total devotion without calculation.

"Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her." And here we are, two thousand years later, still speaking of her unnamed devotion. She who broke the alabaster box remembered forever while Judas who complained is remembered for betrayal.

The Passover prepared - a man bearing water (unusual, women's work) as the sign. Everything orchestrated. "The Master saith" - and immediately a large upper room furnished and prepared. Your authority arranging every detail of Your own sacrifice.

"One of you which eateth with me shall betray me." They each ask "Is it I?" - at least having the humility to question themselves rather than point at others. Even Judas asks, maintaining the deception to the end. "Good were it for that man if he had never been born" - the tragedy of existing only to betray.

"Take, eat: this is my body." The bread broken, distributed. "This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many." The cup shared by all. The New Covenant Jeremiah prophesied now sealed in blood. "I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God." The next cup will be in glory.

"I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered" - Zechariah's prophecy about to unfold. Peter's boast: "Although all shall be offended, yet will not I." The very words revealing the pride that ensures his fall. "Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice." Specific, unavoidable, yet Peter argues "more vehemently."

Gethsemane - Mark alone tells us You were "sore amazed" - the Greek ekthambeisthai, utter astonishment, as if the weight of what's coming suddenly strikes with full force. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death" - sorrow that could kill before the cross ever comes.

"Abba, Father" - Mark preserves the Aramaic, Your intimate cry to the Father. The word a child uses, "Papa." In Your deepest agony, approaching God as beloved child. "All things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt." Perfect submission within perfect relationship.

Three times You pray while the disciples sleep. "Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?" The one renamed "Rock" can't stay awake for sixty minutes. "The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak" - understanding their failure even while facing Your own supreme test.

"Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come." Almost sarcasm - now that it's too late, sleep all you want. The watching time is over; the hour has arrived. "The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners."

"Immediately" - Mark's favorite word appears as Judas arrives. The kiss - the greeting of honor and affection become the sign of betrayal. "Master, master" - saying it twice, overselling the deception. The arrest swift, violent, disciples scattering as prophesied.

The young man with only a linen cloth - many think this is Mark himself, the only Gospel to record this detail. Grabbed, he flees naked rather than be captured. Everyone abandons You - even those not officially disciples run away undressed rather than stand with You.

Before the high priest - false witnesses whose testimonies don't agree. The charge about destroying the temple twisted from Your words about Your body being the true temple. Their lies can't even coordinate properly.

"Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?" Finally, the direct question. Mark records Your clear answer that Matthew only implies: "I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven." No ambiguity. The claim that demands either worship or execution.

Meanwhile Peter in the courtyard, warming himself at the fire. Following "afar off" - close enough to see, far enough to deny connection. The servants recognizing him while inside You're being condemned. The contrast: You boldly claiming Your identity while Peter desperately denies his.

Through Prayer 38's witness of the rejected stone becoming cornerstone, I see You here choosing rejection. Every moment of this agony voluntary. "All things are possible unto thee" - You could stop this instantly. Instead, "not what I will, but what thou wilt." The cup that must be drunk for the many.

The watching command echoes through these passages - watch for His return, watch in the garden, watch in trial. Yet all fall asleep, all flee, all deny. Only You remain awake to the Father's will, facing the hour alone. The Shepherd struck, the sheep scattered, yet the Shepherd willingly receives the blow.

Amen.
