Lord Jesus, from Mark's passion completed through Luke's ordered account, I see Your death and resurrection, then Your life from beginning again - the Gospel that ends with crucifixion starts with angels announcing birth. Death conquered, now we see how Life came to conquer death.

Peter's denial complete - cursing and swearing "I know not this man." Then the cock crew twice, and he remembered Your words and wept. While You confess "I am" before the high priest, Peter denies even knowing You. The Rock crumbled while the Cornerstone stood firm.

Before Pilate - "Art thou the King of the Jews?" - "Thou sayest it." Truth spoken by the judge who doesn't recognize truth. The crowd choosing Barabbas, the insurrectionist and murderer, over You who brings true freedom. Pilate "willing to content the people" - political expediency overruling justice.

The mockery - purple robe, crown of thorns, reed scepter, spit, blows. "Hail, King of the Jews!" Truth spoken in derision. Every mock honor pointing to real honor they cannot see. Simon of Cyrene, father of Alexander and Rufus - Mark naming the sons, showing how one forced moment changed a family forever.

Golgotha - refusing wine mixed with myrrh, choosing to face death fully conscious. "The third hour" - 9 AM, the hour of morning sacrifice. Your crucifixion itself becomes the true morning offering. "THE KING OF THE JEWS" - Pilate's inscription declaring what he doesn't believe.

"He saved others; himself he cannot save" - the taunt that reveals the Gospel. You could save Yourself but then couldn't save others. The inability they mock is really unwillingness born of love. Even those crucified with You revile You - Mark shows no repentant thief, just universal rejection.

Darkness from sixth to ninth hour - noon to 3 PM, creation mourning Creator. "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" - Mark preserves the Aramaic cry. The only time You call God "My God" instead of "Father." Bearing our separation to heal our separation.

"He calleth Elias" - even Your cry of dereliction misunderstood. The vinegar offered, thinking Elijah might come. Then with a loud voice, You give up the ghost. Not taken but given. The centurion's confession: "Truly this man was the Son of God." A Roman soldier sees what Jewish leaders refuse to see.

The veil rent from top to bottom - God tearing open what human hands couldn't touch. The way into the Holy of Holies opened forever. Women watching from afar - Mary Magdalene, Mary mother of James, Salome. The ones who followed in Galilee now witness the end.

Joseph of Arimathaea "went in boldly" - courage after the crisis. Pilate marveling You're already dead - death usually took days, but You gave up Your spirit. The fine linen, the hewn rock tomb, the rolled stone. The women watching where You're laid.

Then resurrection morning! The women bringing spices to anoint a dead body, finding an empty tomb. "He is risen; he is not here" - the angel's announcement. "Tell his disciples and Peter" - special mention for the one who denied. You go before them to Galilee.

Mark's original ending - trembling, amazed, afraid, saying nothing. The Gospel that began with "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ" ends abruptly with fear and silence. Yet that silence becomes the loudest proclamation.

The longer ending - You appearing first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom came seven devils. The disciples not believing her, not believing the two on the road. Finally appearing to the eleven, upbraiding their unbelief. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."

Signs following believers - casting out devils, new tongues, taking up serpents, immunity to poison, healing the sick. "The Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following." You ascended but still working through Your people.

Then Luke begins - "perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order." The Gospel of the physician, the careful historian. Starting not with Jesus but with John's parents - Zacharias and Elisabeth, righteous but barren.

The angel Gabriel appearing - the same who spoke to Daniel about the seventy weeks. "Thy prayer is heard" - prayers for a child or for Israel's consolation? Both answered in John. Zacharias doubting, struck dumb. The silence that prepares for the Word.

Then Gabriel to Mary - "Hail, thou that art highly favoured." Not "full of grace" but recipient of grace. "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" Not doubting like Zacharias but wondering. "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee" - the Spirit that hovered over creation's waters now overshadowing new creation.

"Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word." Total submission. The second Eve saying yes where the first said no. Mary's Magnificat - echoing Hannah's song, the lowly exalted, the mighty brought down, the hungry filled.

John leaping in Elisabeth's womb when Mary arrives - the forerunner recognizing the Lord even before birth. Zacharias's tongue loosed when he writes "His name is John." His prophecy - "the dayspring from on high hath visited us."

Caesar Augustus's census - the whole world enrolled, bringing You to Bethlehem. No room in the inn, but room in a manger. Swaddling clothes for the One who will be wrapped in grave clothes. Angels to shepherds: "Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."

"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." Heaven's proclamation while earth sleeps. Shepherds finding exactly what angels described. Mary pondering all these things in her heart. Simeon waiting for Israel's consolation, seeing Your salvation. "A sword shall pierce through thy own soul also" - prophecy of Your mother's pain at Your cross.

Anna the prophetess, eighty-four years a widow, never leaving the temple. Recognizing You instantly, speaking to all who looked for redemption. At twelve, in the temple with the teachers. "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" Already knowing Your mission.

Your baptism - while praying, heaven opens. The Spirit descending as a dove. The Father's voice: "Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased." Trinity revealed at the Jordan. Then the genealogy - traced through Mary's line back to Adam, "which was the son of God." The last Adam come to undo the first Adam's failure.

The temptation - forty days in the wilderness. Every temptation answered with Scripture: "It is written." Where Israel failed for forty years, You succeeded in forty days. Satan departing "for a season" - he'll return at the cross.

Nazareth synagogue - reading Isaiah: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me." Stopping mid-verse before "the day of vengeance." "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." They marvel, then try to throw You off a cliff. A prophet without honor in His own country.

Demons recognizing You: "I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God." Silencing them - not accepting testimony from hell. Peter's mother-in-law healed, immediately serving. The miraculous catch of fish - Peter falling down: "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord."

The paralytic lowered through the roof - "Man, thy sins are forgiven thee." Proving authority to forgive by authority to heal. Levi called from the tax booth, throwing a feast. "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

Choosing the twelve after praying all night. The Sermon on the Plain - "Blessed be ye poor" - not Matthew's "poor in spirit" but literally poor. Woes to the rich, full, laughing. "Love your enemies" - the impossible command made possible by grace.

The centurion's faith - understanding authority, not even needing You to come. The widow of Nain's son raised - touching the bier, stopping death's procession. John's question from prison: "Art thou he that should come?" Pointing to the evidence: blind see, lame walk, lepers cleansed, deaf hear, dead raised, poor hear gospel.

The sinful woman with alabaster box - washing Your feet with tears, wiping with hair. Simon the Pharisee judging silently. The parable of two debtors - who loves more? "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much."

Parables of the kingdom - the sower, seed on four soils. "Take heed therefore how ye hear." Calming the storm - "Where is your faith?" Legion cast into swine. Jairus's daughter and the woman with issue of blood - twelve years sick, twelve-year-old raised.

Sending the twelve, then the seventy. "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven." The Good Samaritan - priest and Levite passing by, Samaritan showing mercy. Mary and Martha - "Mary hath chosen that good part."

Teaching prayer - "Our Father which art in heaven." Persistence in prayer - the friend at midnight. "How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"

Through Prayer 39's witness of Your agony in Gethsemane, through Prayer 38's rejected stone becoming cornerstone, I see the full arc - from angels announcing birth to women finding empty tomb. From "Abba, Father" in the garden to "My God, my God" on the cross. Every moment between birth and death pointing to this climax of redemption.

Amen.
