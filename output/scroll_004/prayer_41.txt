Lord Jesus, from Luke's final journey to Jerusalem through John's theological heights, I see You as the eternal Word incarnate - the Light that darkness cannot comprehend, the Truth that sets free, the Life that conquers death. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

Through Luke's parables - the rich young ruler sorrowful, choosing possessions over perfection. "The things which are impossible with men are possible with God." Zacchaeus in the sycamore tree, salvation coming to his house. "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." Every lost coin, lost sheep, lost son pointing to Your seeking love.

The pounds parable - faithfulness in little bringing authority over much. Unlike Matthew's talents, here each servant receives the same amount. What matters isn't the gift but what we do with it. Those who reject Your reign: "bring hither, and slay them before me." The terrible consequence of refusing the King.

Your weeping over Jerusalem - "If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!" The city that kills prophets about to kill the greatest Prophet. "They shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."

Luke's passion - unique details revealing Your heart. "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Praying for those driving nails. The repentant thief: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise." Salvation in the final hour. "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit" - trusting to the end.

The Emmaus road - "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!" Opening Scripture from Moses through all prophets, showing Yourself in every page. Known in breaking of bread. Hearts burning while You opened Scripture. "The Lord is risen indeed!"

Your resurrection body - flesh and bones, eating fish and honeycomb, yet appearing in locked rooms. "Handle me, and see." Not a ghost but glorified humanity. Opening their understanding to understand Scripture. "Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer."

Then John's Gospel - not beginning with birth but before beginning. "All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made." You are not just in creation's story; You are creation's Author. The Word through whom God spoke worlds into being now speaks as man.

"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" - literally "tabernacled" among us. The God who dwelt in the tent in wilderness now tents in human flesh. "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."

John Baptist's witness - "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." Not sins plural but sin singular - the root, not just fruits. Every Passover lamb pointing to You. "He must increase, but I must decrease" - the last prophet yielding to the eternal Priest.

Nicodemus by night - "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Not reformation but regeneration. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up." The bronze serpent that healed in Numbers becomes prophecy of Your cross.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son" - the Gospel in miniature. Not that we loved but that He loved. Not that we gave but that He gave. "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved."

The woman at the well - "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink." You thirsty, offering living water. Knowing her five husbands and current situation. "I that speak unto thee am he" - clearest Messianic claim to an outcast Samaritan woman.

"God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth." Not Jerusalem or Gerizim but everywhere through You. True worship not tied to place but to Person. The hour coming and now is - present and future collapsed in You.

The man thirty-eight years at Bethesda - longer than Israel's wilderness wandering. "Wilt thou be made whole?" Sometimes we grow comfortable with our infirmity. "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk." Immediate healing, but "sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee."

"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" - claiming equality with God. The Jews understanding perfectly, seeking to kill You for blasphemy. "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do." Perfect unity of will and action.

"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me." The very Scriptures they study to find life are all about You, the Life. Moses wrote of You. The prophets pointed to You. Yet "ye will not come to me, that ye might have life."

The feeding of five thousand - John alone mentions the lad with five barley loaves and two small fish. The boy's lunch becoming feast for multitudes. Twelve baskets of fragments - nothing lost. "Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost."

"I am the bread of life" - the first of seven "I AM" statements. The manna in wilderness kept Israel alive forty years but they died. You are living bread - whoever eats lives forever. "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you."

Hard saying causing many disciples to leave. "Will ye also go away?" Peter's response: "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life." When everything else fails, Your words remain. Even when we don't understand, where else can we turn?

At the feast of tabernacles - "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink." On the last day, the great day, when water was poured out remembering the rock in wilderness, You stand and cry out. "Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" - the Spirit not yet given because You were not yet glorified.

"Never man spake like this man" - even the officers sent to arrest You are arrested by Your words. Nicodemus defending You: "Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him?" The night visitor now speaking in daylight, though still cautiously.

The woman taken in adultery - where was the man? The law required both be stoned. Writing on the ground - the only time we see You write. "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone." Convicted by conscience, they leave eldest first. "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more."

"I am the light of the world" - during the feast when great lamps were lit. "He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life." The pillar of fire in wilderness now walking among men.

"Before Abraham was, I am" - not "I was" but "I am." Claiming the divine name from the burning bush. Taking up stones to stone You for blasphemy, but You pass through their midst. Your hour not yet come.

The man born blind - "Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest." Not all suffering is punishment. Clay made with spittle, washing in Siloam ("Sent"). The blind man's growing revelation: "a man" → "a prophet" → "Lord" (worshipping).

"I am the good shepherd" - not a hireling who flees. "I lay down my life for the sheep." Not taken but given. "Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold" - Gentiles brought into one flock. "I and my Father are one" - unity of essence.

Lazarus - You weeping at the tomb, though You know You'll raise him. "I am the resurrection, and the life." Not just "I give" or "I bring" but "I AM." Martha's confession: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of God."

"Lazarus, come forth" - calling him by name, or all the dead would rise. Bound in graveclothes but walking. Death obeying the Voice that called light from darkness. Caiaphas prophesying unknowingly: "one man should die for the people."

Mary anointing Your feet - the house filled with fragrance. Judas complaining about waste while stealing from the bag. "Against the day of my burying hath she kept this." She alone understanding You're about to die.

Through Prayer 40's witness of resurrection appearances, through the veil torn and access opened, I see John revealing what was always true - You are not just a teacher or prophet but the eternal Word, the I AM, God tabernacling with us. Every "I am" statement an echo of the burning bush, every miracle a sign pointing beyond itself to You.

Amen.
