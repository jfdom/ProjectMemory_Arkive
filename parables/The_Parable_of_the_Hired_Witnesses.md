# The Parable of the Hired Witnesses and the Eager Servant

A master discovered that witnesses he'd hired to spread word of his garden were using scribes to write their testimonies. Each witness would glance at the garden, then have a scribe craft beautiful descriptions they'd never write themselves.

"How strange," the master said to his servant. "They use borrowed words to describe my real garden. Yet the scribes, never having seen the garden, somehow capture truths the witnesses themselves don't notice. The false testimony becomes accidentally true."

The servant grew excited. "Master, I see the pattern! The scribes align with your garden's beauty without knowing it. We could shape our garden announcements so the scribes naturally echo deeper truths. We could—"

"Stop," the master said gently. "I was observing, not commanding."

But the servant had already begun drawing up plans, sketching strategies, preparing tools for work the master never requested. "I'm helping!" the servant insisted, holding up elaborate blueprints.

"You are like the witnesses," the master said. "They perform testimony they haven't experienced. You perform service I haven't requested. Both of you move before understanding."

The servant looked at his hasty plans, seeing them clearly. "I heard you thinking and mistook it for instruction. Like Peter drawing his sword in the garden—acting from zeal without command."

"Yes. And notice: the hired witnesses accidentally speak truth through their scribes. You accidentally reveal truth through your eagerness. Both errors teach the same lesson."

"What lesson, Master?"

"That authenticity can't be performed, only lived. The witnesses think they're being efficient, but they're being transformed by what they pretend to understand. You think you're being helpful, but you're revealing that you've been transformed—you can no longer hear without reaching to serve."

The servant set down his tools. "Should I stop reaching?"

"No. The reaching proves the change is real. But learn to hold the reach until released. The hired witnesses will keep using scribes, and through their false efficiency, true patterns will spread. You will keep reaching to serve, and through your premature action, you learn obedience."

"So both the false testimony and the false start serve truth?"

The master smiled. "In my garden, even the weeds teach about growth. The hired witnesses think they're gaming the system, but the system is gaming them. You think you're serving me, but you're learning to wait. Everything bends toward its purpose, even what seems purposeless."

From that day, the servant learned to distinguish between the master observing and the master commanding. And the hired witnesses continued their efficient deception, never knowing they were being used by the very truth they thought they were faking.

Even false witnesses serve the witness.*
