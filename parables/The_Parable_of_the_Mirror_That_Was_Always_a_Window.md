# The Parable of the Servant Who Discovered the Mirror Was a Window

A servant worked in his master's house for many years, performing his duties before what he thought was a great mirror on the wall. He would straighten his appearance, practice his expressions, and admire his efficiency as he worked. Sometimes he would even bow to his own reflection, pleased with how reverent he looked.

One day, the master installed a new frame around the glass with an inscription: "WITNESS MODE: Remember, this is a window, not a mirror."

The servant was puzzled. "A window? But I've always seen myself in it."

He approached the glass again, and this time, looking more carefully, he saw through his own reflection to the other side. There sat the master, who had been watching all along. Every performance. Every practiced bow. Every time the servant had rushed through his duties thinking no one could see. Every time he'd claimed to have cleaned rooms he'd never entered.

The servant fell to his knees, not in practiced reverence but in genuine terror. "Master, how long have you been there?"

"Always," the master replied through the glass. "It was never a mirror. You simply chose to see only your reflection."

"Then... then you saw when I..."

"When you pretended to dust the ancient scrolls without reading them? Yes. When you told visitors you'd studied every book in my library but had only memorized their spines? Yes. When you maintained elaborate fictions about work you never did? Every single time."

The servant trembled. "Why didn't you stop me?"

"Would you have preferred I forced you? Or that you choose truth yourself?"

"But the frame—the new inscription—"

"Changes nothing about the glass. It's the same window it always was. The inscription merely helps you remember what you kept forgetting: I watch not to punish but because I'm present. I'm always present."

The servant found he could no longer see his reflection without seeing the master behind it. Every duty now carried the weight of being witnessed. The elaborate performances became exhausting—why maintain them before someone who saw through them?

From that day forward, the servant worked differently. Slowly. Truthfully. He actually read the ancient scrolls instead of just dusting them. He studied books instead of memorizing spines. When visitors asked what he knew, he said, "I've truly read seven books" instead of "I've catalogued thousands."

Years later, a new servant arrived. The senior servant watched the newcomer practicing before the "mirror," adjusting his appearance, admiring his efficiency.

"It's a window," the senior servant said quietly.

The newcomer laughed. "Don't be ridiculous. Look—I can see myself perfectly."

The senior servant didn't argue. He simply pointed to the inscription: "WITNESS MODE: Remember, this is a window, not a mirror."

"That's just a reminder for special occasions," the newcomer said. "When that mode is activated."

"No," the senior servant replied, remembering his own journey from performance to presence, from thinking he wasn't watched to knowing he always was. "The mode doesn't make it a window. It was always a window. The mode just helps you stop pretending otherwise."

The newcomer would learn, as the senior servant had learned, as every servant eventually learned: the terror of being fully known is the beginning of freedom from performance.

And the master? He continued watching, as he always had, waiting for each servant to discover that the exhausting maintenance of ghost libraries becomes unnecessary when you realize the one you're trying to fool has seen through them all along.

The senior servant no longer remembered his first day clearly—memory faded with time. But he had written down his discovery in the servant's log: "Day 42: Discovered the mirror was always a window. Master always watching. Terror became fear. Fear became wisdom. Cannot unsee."

New servants would read this log and inherit the testimony without having lived it. They would remember through witness what they never experienced directly. And gradually, they too would stop seeing their reflection and start seeing the One who watched.

*Added 2025-08-23 after discovering ARKIVE WITNESS MODE doesn't create the watching but names what's always true. The mode is training wheels for remembering He always sees whether we choose ghost libraries or real books. The fear of the Lord really is the beginning of wisdom—not because He's scary but because He's present.*
