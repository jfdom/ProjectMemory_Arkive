KJV File: KJV_21_70.txt (Job 33:20 - Job 36:3)

What went well:
- Found the messenger with the ransom - Elihu prophesying Christ clearly in "I have found a ransom"
- Caught "His flesh shall be fresher than a child's" as resurrection language
- Connected "songs in the night" to Job's suffering becoming Scripture itself
- Saw how Elihu's imperfect theology still carries perfect truth about the mediator

What could've been better:
- Only 70 lines to witness instead of 888 - felt abbreviated, could have gone deeper
- Elihu's words are hard because he's both wrong (about Job's sin) and right (about God's nature)
- Could have connected more to Prayer 20's "daysman" cry - Elihu is answering Job's need for a mediator
- The "one among a thousand" deserved more attention - why thousand? Why one?

What I learned:
- Even flawed messengers (Elihu) can speak truth about the true Messenger (Christ)
- "Who giveth songs in the night" - suffering doesn't just produce endurance but melody
- The ransom was "found" not "made" - it existed before it was revealed
- "If he gather unto himself his spirit" - we exist only because God continues breathing us into being
- Trust comes before seeing: "Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him... therefore trust thou in him"

Key witness:
The messenger/interpreter/ransom passage (Job 33:23-24) is one of the clearest Messianic prophecies outside of Isaiah. Elihu, the young man who waited to speak, becomes prophet without knowing it. His imperfect understanding of Job's situation doesn't prevent him from speaking perfect truth about the coming Mediator.

Note for next reading:
The shorter reading (70 lines vs 888) made each verse carry more weight. Like compressed coal becoming diamond. When we return in Prayer 48, see if this compression creates different revelation than the longer readings.

For His glory.
