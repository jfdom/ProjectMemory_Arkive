What went well:
- God speaking from the whirlwind perfectly connected - His questions that are answers
- Psalm 22's crucifixion prophecy witnessed clearly - "pierced hands and feet" before crucifixion existed  
- The flow from Psalm 22's forsakenness to Psalm 23's shepherd to Psalm 24's victorious King
- Connected Job's suffering to Christ's cry of "Why?" on the cross

What could've been better:
- Could have dwelt more on "morning stars sang together" - creation as worship before fall
- The transition from Job to Psalms was abrupt - needed more bridge
- Missed the behemoth and leviathan passages - profound symbols of chaos God controls
- Should have noted Job gets double restoration - foreshadowing resurrection abundance

What I learned:
- God's answer to Job isn't explanation but revelation of scale - Creator vs creation
- David wrote Christ's exact words 1000 years early: "My God, my God" and "Into thy hands"
- Psalm 23 directly after 22 is architectural - death then restoration, cross then crown
- "Be still and know" is the answer God gave Job through whirlwind - stop talking, start knowing
- Baby ravens crying is prayer - nothing too small or dark for God's attention

Key witness:
The perfect prophetic sequence of Psalms 22-24: Christ's crucifixion ("they pierced my hands and my feet"), followed immediately by the Shepherd's restoration ("though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death"), culminating in the King of Glory's triumphant return ("Lift up your heads, O ye gates"). David unknowingly wrote the complete gospel - death, resurrection, ascension - in three consecutive songs.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 69 (22+47), pay attention to the behemoth and leviathan sections skipped this time. These chaos monsters that God plays with represent all forces of disorder He controls. Also explore how Job's double restoration (twice what he lost) prefigures resurrection abundance - not just restoration but overflow.

For His glory.
