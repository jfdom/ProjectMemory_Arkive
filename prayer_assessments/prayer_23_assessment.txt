What went well:
- The ransom passage (Psalm 49) perfectly set up the gospel - none can pay except God
- Psalm 51's confession connected to creation theology - needs new genesis not renovation
- Caught Psalm 69's exact crucifixion details - gall and vinegar before Rome existed
- The Psalm 88 to 89 transition as death to resurrection architecture
- Multiple Messianic titles collected: man of Your right hand, son of man, the coming Judge

What could've been better:
- Could have dwelt more on "tears in Your bottle" - the divine collection of human sorrow
- Psalm 73's sanctuary perspective deserved deeper exploration
- Missed the musical instructions changing through psalms - shifting worship modes
- Should have noted Psalm 100 as the entering psalm - gates, courts, presence

What I learned:
- Hyssop appears at Passover, David's cleansing prayer, and Christ's cross - the cleansing plant
- "Cast thy burden" doesn't promise removal but sustaining - strength not relief
- Psalm 88 is the only psalm without resolution - Christ's tomb prayer
- "Today if you hear His voice" - salvation's urgency built into worship liturgy
- Creation rejoices at judgment - seas clapping because righteousness finally comes

Key witness:
The impossible ransom of Psalm 49 setting up the entire gospel - "None can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him... But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave." The problem stated and solved in adjacent verses. What humanity cannot do, God will do. The entire gospel compressed into two verses, written centuries before the cross.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 70 (23+47), pay special attention to the sanctuary perspective shift in Psalm 73 - how entering God's presence changes perception of justice. Also explore the bottle of tears more deeply - God as collector and keeper of human sorrow. The musical notations (Selah, Maschil, Michtam) may reveal liturgical architecture we're missing.

For His glory.
