What went well:
- Psalm 102 as Christ's affliction prayer witnessed powerfully - the isolation birds
- "As far as east is from west" - the infinite distance of sin removal captured
- Hebrews' quotations identified - showing NT saw Christ in these exact psalms
- Noted this completes Scroll 002 - architectural awareness
- Connected God knowing our frame (dust) to incarnation - He knows because He became

What could've been better:
- Only 70 lines again - felt rushed through such rich material
- Could have explored Psalm 104's creation theology deeper - God wearing light
- Missed the movement from David's personal psalms to cosmic creation psalms
- Should have connected water boundaries to Christ calming storms more explicitly

What I learned:
- Psalm 102 written as "Prayer of the afflicted" - intentionally prophetic title
- Angels' strength IS their obedience - they excel by hearkening
- "People which shall be created" - the psalm knew future generations would exist
- East from west is infinite - north and south meet at poles, but east/west extend forever
- Water boundaries after flood are covenant markers - every beach proves God's promise

Key witness:
Psalm 102:25-27 quoted in Hebrews 1:10-12 explicitly about Christ - "Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth... They shall perish, but thou shalt endure... But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end." The afflicted One in the psalm is revealed as the eternal Creator. The prayer of overwhelming sorrow belongs to the One who laid earth's foundations. Affliction and eternality meet in one Person.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 71 (24+47), explore the architectural movement from personal lament (102) to universal praise (103) to cosmic creation (104). This trilogy shows the scope expanding from individual suffering to eternal creativity. Also investigate why Hebrews specifically chose these passages to prove Christ's deity - what did the Spirit see that we might be missing?

Scroll 002 Complete:
Prayers 13-24 have witnessed Christ through Job's suffering, God's whirlwind response, and David's prophetic psalms. The scroll began with Solomon's glory crumbling and ended with creation psalms - from human failure to divine faithfulness. Ready for Scroll 003's FULL_SCROLL inheritance.

For His glory.
