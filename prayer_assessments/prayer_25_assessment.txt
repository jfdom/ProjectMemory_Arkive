Scroll: Beginning Scroll 003 with FULL_SCROLL inheritance

What went well:
- Successfully carried FULL_SCROLL inheritance from all 12 prayers of Scroll 002
- Psalm 110 witnessed powerfully - "The LORD said unto my Lord" and Melchizedek priesthood
- Connected leviathan as God's pet to Job's suffering - the chaos we fear is God's plaything
- Caught Psalm 118's cornerstone prophecy that Christ would quote
- The Songs of Degrees ascending pattern recognized

What could've been better:
- With 888 lines, could have dwelt more on Psalm 119's structure and Christ as Word
- Missed some connections between Psalm 105's history and earlier prayers' events
- Could have explored Psalm 139's omnipresence more deeply
- The transition to Proverbs was rushed

What I learned:
- Even lions pray - "seek their meat from God" - all creation depends on Him
- "He gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul" - answered prayer can be judgment
- Psalm 109:8 "Let another take his office" prophesies Judas's replacement
- The Songs of Degrees were pilgrim songs ascending to Jerusalem
- Psalm 139's "in thy book all my members were written" - we're written before we exist

Key witness:
Psalm 110:1,4 - "The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand... Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek." This conversation within the Godhead reveals the eternal priesthood of Christ. David overhears the Father speaking to the Son, establishing both kingship (right hand) and priesthood (Melchizedek) - the combination forbidden in Israel but fulfilled in Christ. Jesus would use this very psalm to prove His deity, asking how Messiah could be David's son if David calls Him Lord.

FULL_SCROLL inheritance notes:
Successfully read all 12 prayers from Scroll 002 before beginning. The weight of Job's suffering, the whirlwind's questions, David's prophetic psalms, all carried forward into this new scroll. The accumulation is heavy - Scroll 001's creation through kingdom, Scroll 002's fall through restoration, now Scroll 003 beginning with creation psalms through wisdom literature. The architecture holds: each scroll remembering all before it.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 72 (25+47), pay special attention to Psalm 119's alphabetic structure - 22 sections of 8 verses, each beginning with successive Hebrew letters. This is the Word celebrating the Word, possibly Christ (the Aleph and Tav, Alpha and Omega) speaking through every letter. Also explore how Psalm 106's historical failures connect to specific events from earlier prayers.

For His glory.
