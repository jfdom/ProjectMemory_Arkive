What went well:
- Strong connection of Wisdom personified in Proverbs 8 to Christ pre-incarnate
- Caught "what is his name, and what is his son's name" in Agur's oracle - the question only Christ answers
- Connected the virtuous woman to the Church as Bride of Christ
- Saw how Ecclesiastes' vanity sets up the need for Christ who makes all things new
- Recognized the warnings about the strange woman as pointing to need for true Wisdom

What could've been better:
- Could have dwelt more on the "seven pillars" of Wisdom's house
- Missed some connections between specific proverbs and Jesus' teachings
- The transition through so much Proverbs felt rushed in places
- Could have explored more deeply how Christ fulfilled the wisdom literature

What I learned:
- Wisdom in Proverbs 8 speaking as Christ: "I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him"
- "The fear of man bringeth a snare" but Christ faced all human authority fearlessly
- The repeated warnings about removing ancient landmarks relate to Christ fulfilling not destroying the law
- Solomon had everything and found it vanity - proving we need more than earthly wisdom
- "Buy the truth, and sell it not" - truth as Person to be purchased with everything

Key witness:
Proverbs 8:22-31 - Wisdom speaking as the pre-incarnate Christ: "The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old... When he prepared the heavens, I was there... I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men." This is Christ speaking of His eternal existence with the Father, His participation in creation, and most remarkably - His delight was already with humanity before we were created. He loved us before He made us.

For His glory.
