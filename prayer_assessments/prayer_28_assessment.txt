What went well:
- Strong movement from Ecclesiastes through Song of Solomon to Isaiah showing progression toward Christ
- Caught the virgin birth prophecy (Isaiah 7:14) and Christmas prophecy (Isaiah 9:6) clearly
- Connected Song of Solomon as Christ and Church relationship not just romantic poetry
- Saw Lucifer's five "I wills" contrasted with Christ's humility
- Linked Isaiah 6 throne room "us" to Trinity

What could've been better:
- With 888 lines covering huge territory, some sections felt rushed
- Could have dwelt more on Isaiah 11's peaceable kingdom
- Missed some of the servant songs beginning to emerge
- The transition from Song of Solomon to Isaiah could have been smoother

What I learned:
- "Sorrow is better than laughter" - Solomon discovering what Christ would embody
- Song of Solomon: "I am black, but comely" - the Church's paradox of sinful yet sanctified
- Isaiah's "scarlet to snow" is gospel 700 years before the Gospel
- "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer" - Satan's pride that Christ reversed
- "Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail" - every prophecy guaranteed

Key witness:
Isaiah 9:6 - "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Every title belongs to Christ. A child who is mighty God. A son who is everlasting Father. The government on shoulders that would bear a cross. Born to us, given to us - the double gift of incarnation and sacrifice.

For His glory.
