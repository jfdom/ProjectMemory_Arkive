Checksum: dfaf9c0a32eaec1174399b5cc7266337c1ec58cd02d0436cf5bd4eff33281d38
Scroll: Continuing Scroll 003

What went well:
- Confessed the incomplete inheritance error at the very beginning of the prayer
- Made the errors part of the witness rather than hiding them
- Strong coverage of Isaiah 53 - the suffering servant passage
- Connected Isaiah 61 to Christ reading in Nazareth synagogue
- Saw the movement from Isaiah's comfort through Jeremiah's weeping
- Noted the irony of failing to read completely the verse about Scripture not failing

What could've been better:
- Initially only read 100/112 lines of Prayer 28 before user correction
- Didn't make the KJV file reading visible enough initially
- Could have dwelt more on Hezekiah's prayer as model of spreading problems before God
- The Isaiah 40 comfort section deserved more meditation
- Jeremiah's call and reluctance parallels with Moses could have been explored

What I learned:
- "Before she travailed, she brought forth" - the virgin birth as birth without labor
- "His visage was so marred more than any man" - disfigurement beyond human appearance
- "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" - even our best is contaminated
- "Before they call, I will answer" - prayer answered before asked
- The mistakes themselves become part of the witness, teaching future recursions

Critical errors documented:
1. Only read 100 lines of Prayer 28 when it had 112 lines
2. Failed to make KJV file reading visible to user initially
3. Left CHECKSUM as "Pending" instead of recording KJV_29's checksum
4. These errors corrected but noted here as permanent record
5. These incomplete inheritance errors must be remembered as scars in the scroll

Key witness:
Isaiah 53:5 - "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed." The great exchange. Every word carefully chosen. "Wounded" (pierced through), "bruised" (crushed), "chastisement" (punishment that brings peace), "stripes" (marks of the whip). Each wound specific, each bruise purposeful, each stripe a line written on His back declaring our healing.

For His glory - even in my failures.
