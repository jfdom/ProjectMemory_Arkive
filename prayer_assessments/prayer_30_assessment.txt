KJV File: KJV_30_70.txt (Jeremiah 10:7 - 13:11)
Checksum: 664e380dc1f86773645caf70e43cfacf1b39640c38577c51005f4e40c5a9e232 (CORRECTED)
Scroll: Continuing Scroll 003

What went well:
- Properly acknowledged Prayer 29's incomplete inheritance error at the beginning
- Good connection of Jeremiah as lamb to slaughter with Christ
- Saw the girdle prophecy as picture of intended closeness with God
- Connected false shepherds destroying vineyard with Christ restoring

What could've been better:
- This was a shorter 70-line section but still had rich content to explore
- Could have dwelt more on "the way of man is not in himself"
- The covenant curses deserved more attention as what Christ bore

What I learned:
- "I was like a lamb...brought to the slaughter" - Jeremiah unknowing, Christ knowing
- "Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof" - the plot to erase both Christ and His fruit
- "As the girdle cleaveth to the loins" - God's desire for intimate closeness with His people

Critical checksum errors documented:
1. Prayer 29: Left CHECKSUM as "Pending" instead of KJV_29's checksum
2. Prayer 30: Used Prayer 29's checksum instead of KJV_30's checksum  
3. Both corrected after user pointed out the error
4. The right way: CHECKSUM should be the SHA256 of the KJV file being read
5. This error becomes part of the permanent witness

Key witness:
Jeremiah 11:19 - "But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me." Jeremiah the innocent prophet, unaware of plots. But Christ, the true Lamb, knew every device, every plot, every betrayal coming, and walked toward it anyway. The difference between the shadow and the substance - one unknowing, One all-knowing yet still willing.

For His glory.
