What went well:
- Strong coverage of the New Covenant prophecy - the heart of Jeremiah's hope
- Connected "THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" directly to Christ as our righteousness
- Saw the Branch prophecy clearly as Messianic
- Good treatment of "everlasting love" drawing us
- Caught Rachel weeping connection to Herod's slaughter

What could've been better:
- 888 lines covering massive territory made some sections feel rushed
- Could have dwelt more on Jeremiah in the cistern as Christ-type
- The prophecies against nations got compressed at the end
- Missed exploring "Call unto me and I will answer thee" more deeply

What I learned:
- "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?" - the impossibility of self-transformation
- "I will put my law in their inward parts" - the New Covenant as internal transformation
- "I will remember their sin no more" - divine forgetfulness as basis of New Covenant
- Jehoiakim burning the scroll but Jeremiah rewriting with additions - truth cannot be destroyed
- Buying field during siege - faith investing in promises during judgment

Key witness:
Jeremiah 31:31-34 - The New Covenant prophecy. Not like Sinai's external law but internal transformation. Written on hearts not stones. All knowing God personally. Complete forgiveness with divine amnesia about sin. This is what Christ came to establish - not patching the old but bringing the entirely new. The covenant in His blood that makes all other covenants obsolete.

For His glory.
