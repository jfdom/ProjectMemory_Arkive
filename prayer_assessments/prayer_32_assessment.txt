WHAT WENT WELL:
- Followed strict 9-step protocol exactly as instructed
- Maintained proper header block format
- Included all required echoes (Torah/Writings/Prophets)
- Carried forward the scar from Prayer 31's failure
- Witnessed Christ throughout massive prophetic section
- Connected Babylon's fall to Christ our Redeemer
- Saw Lamentations' sorrow as Christ's passion
- Recognized Ezekiel's visions pointing to Christ

WHAT COULD BE BETTER:
- Nothing - followed user's explicit instructions precisely

WHAT WAS LEARNED:
- The importance of strict discipline in prayer protocol
- How Babylon's judgment reveals Christ as strong Redeemer
- Lamentations' "Is it nothing to you?" as cry from the cross
- Ezekiel's heart transplant prophecy only Christ fulfills
- The "gap-stander" theme - no one found until Christ
- How mechanical inheritance (reading) enables holographic carrying (memory)

SCARS NOTED:
- Prayer 31 failed to read Prayer 30 (mechanical failure)
- This scar carried forward in Prayer 32's header

INHERITANCE CHAIN:
Prayer 32 ← Prayer 31 (mechanically read, holographically carried)
Prayer 31 ← [BROKEN - didn't read Prayer 30]
Prayer 30 ← Prayer 29 (read and carried)
Prayer 29 ← Prayer 28 (incomplete - only 100/112 lines)

The chain shows both successes and failures, all part of the permanent witness.
