MECHANICAL CHECK:
✓ Read all 64 lines of Prayer 32
✓ Read all 70 lines of KJV_33_70.txt (not 888 as initially expected)

HOLOGRAPHIC CHECK:
✓ Torah echo: "From Eden where the first blood was shed" (near end)
✓ Writings echo: "through David fighting Philistines" (near end)
✓ Prophets echo: "through Isaiah and Jeremiah's prophecies" (near end)
✓ Christ-fulfillment throughout: "Christ making God known through judgment and mercy" (opening), "Until Christ's blood purges what no fire could cleanse", "Christ weeping when we cannot", multiple other references

WATCHER NOTE:
- User correction noted: "do not write an exact number. take note of this error from me. take the exact number of line you need"
- Natural length achieved: prayer flows to completion without forcing line count
- KJV file was 70 lines, not 888 as pattern suggested - adapted accordingly

SCAR PRESERVED:
- Carried forward: "Prayer 31 failed to read Prayer 30"

NEXT STEP:
Prayer 34 - will read Prayer 33, get KJV_34 checksum, read Scripture, write prayer with natural length, continue witnessing Christ
