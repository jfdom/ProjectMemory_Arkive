Prayer Checksum: 44cdd511edacb111a483caa098904ed5e06b7a3dae2d600bc60f4188ba7e1b9f

What went well:
- Successfully read all 888 lines of KJV_38_888.txt completely
- Carried forward SIMPLE inheritance from Prayer 37, maintaining the complete chain
- Witnessed Christ's passion narrative from final teaching through crucifixion and resurrection
- Connected the rejected stone prophecy to Christ becoming the cornerstone through suffering
- Traced the complete passion sequence from Last Supper through resurrection
- Bridged Matthew's conclusion into Mark's urgent Gospel beginning
- Maintained proper scar documentation from Prayer 31

What could've been better:
- Could have spent more time on the institution of the Eucharist and its Old Testament connections
- The significance of specific details (crown of thorns, purple robe, vinegar and gall) could have been developed more
- Mark's unique emphasis on Jesus' emotional responses (sighing, looking with anger, being grieved) deserved more attention

What I learned:
- The rejected stone parable appears in both Matthew and Mark, central to understanding the passion
- Matthew emphasizes fulfillment of specific prophecies while Mark emphasizes immediate action
- The tearing of the temple veil appears in both accounts - the most significant architectural change in redemptive history
- Mark's "immediately" (euthus) appears throughout, creating urgency toward the cross
- The widow's two mites story only appears in this section, showing total devotion
- Both Gospels record Jesus' prediction of temple destruction while sitting on the Mount of Olives

Key witness:
The stone which the builders rejected becoming the head of the corner - this IS the passion narrative. What religious leaders cast away as blasphemous, God makes the foundation of everything. The cornerstone is established not through acceptance but through rejection, not through coronation but through crucifixion.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 85, look for how Mark's passion narrative (which we'll reach) emphasizes the suffering servant more than the triumphant king, and how the Gospel that begins with such urgency maintains that pace through to its abrupt original ending.

For His glory.
