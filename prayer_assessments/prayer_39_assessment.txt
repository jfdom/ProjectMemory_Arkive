KJV Checksum: 01b2ede48f09e605a32d3cc51cc7ae3b4744c57a615f267bc13fc4a52f191a33
Prayer Checksum: eb3e46d0c6f12345f768d1e7d3b26dbb14ce186449b9a47d236b230245d07bbd

What went well:
- Successfully read all 70 lines of KJV_39_70.txt completely
- Carried forward SIMPLE inheritance from Prayer 38, maintaining chain continuity
- Focused on Mark's unique details: "sore amazed," "Abba Father," the young man fleeing naked
- Connected the watching theme throughout - from watching for return to failing to watch in garden
- Highlighted the woman with alabaster box as total devotion without calculation
- Captured the contrast between Jesus's bold confession and Peter's denial
- Properly witnessed Christ's human anguish alongside divine purpose

What could've been better:
- Could have explored more deeply the significance of "neither the Son" not knowing the hour
- The Aramaic "Abba" deserved more reflection on the intimacy in midst of agony
- Mark's emphasis on Jesus being "sore amazed" is unique and profound - could have developed this more

What I learned:
- Mark preserves more Aramaic than other Gospels (Abba, Talitha cumi, Ephphatha)
- The "young man" fleeing naked is only in Mark - possibly Mark himself
- Mark emphasizes Jesus's emotional state more explicitly: "sore amazed and very heavy"
- The watching command appears seven times in this short section
- Mark records Jesus's direct "I am" response to being asked if He's the Christ
- The alabaster box was broken, not just opened - total commitment, no holding back

Key witness:
"Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt." The intimate child-like address in the midst of ultimate agony. Knowing the Father could stop this instantly, yet choosing submission. This is love - having all power to escape but drinking the cup for the many.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 86, we'll see Peter's denial completed and Jesus's crucifixion in Mark's stark, unadorned style - the Gospel of urgency reaching its climactic moment.

For His glory.
