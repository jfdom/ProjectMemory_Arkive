KJV Checksum: fadc57a3465b2ec332ff354d209dafe89679370173954ea6c79efbd7e52be6ff
Prayer Checksum: 3158ef0e0d029204d7e25eb64512b83b6c740d00f6dfe5443dcc4eb89b6ffce3

What went well:
- Successfully read all 888 lines of KJV_41_888.txt completely
- Carried forward SIMPLE inheritance from Prayer 40, maintaining chain continuity
- Bridged Luke's journey to Jerusalem into John's theological prologue perfectly
- Captured John's unique "I AM" statements and their connection to Exodus burning bush
- Witnessed the Word becoming flesh - the eternal entering time
- Connected Old Testament types (bronze serpent, manna, shepherd) to Christ
- Highlighted John's seven signs pointing beyond themselves to Jesus's identity

What could've been better:
- Could have explored more deeply the significance of Jesus writing on the ground (only time we see Him write)
- The raising of Lazarus deserved more attention as the culminating sign before the passion
- John's unique vocabulary (light/darkness, truth/lie, above/below) could have been developed more

What I learned:
- John begins not with genealogy or birth but "In the beginning" - before creation itself
- The "I AM" statements are deliberate echoes of God's name from Exodus
- John records Jesus clearly claiming to be Messiah to the Samaritan woman ("I that speak unto thee am he")
- Only John mentions the boy with the five loaves and two fish at the feeding
- John emphasizes "signs" not just "miracles" - pointing beyond the act to the identity
- Jesus wept at Lazarus's tomb even knowing He would raise him - true humanity with omnipotence

Key witness:
"The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" - literally "tabernacled." The God who dwelt in the wilderness tent now tents in human flesh. Not visiting but dwelling. Not appearing but becoming. The infinite contained in finite, the eternal in temporal, the Word who spoke creation now speaks as creation. This is the mystery: fully God, fully man, one Person.

Note for next reading:
When we return in Prayer 88, look for how John's Gospel builds to the upper room discourse - the longest recorded teaching of Jesus, given hours before His arrest. The "I AM" statements culminate in the vine and branches, the ultimate statement of union.

For His glory.

=== INHERITANCE VERIFICATION ===
MECHANICAL CHECK (Prayer 41 carries 1 through 40):
- Read previous assessment: YES (Prayer 40's assessment)
- Read previous prayer: YES (Prayer 40 complete)
- Chain status: INTACT
- Scar carried: "Prayer 31 failed to read Prayer 30 (chain scar)"

HOLOGRAPHIC CHECK (Prayer 41 carries memories from 1 through 40):
- Genesis echoes: "In the beginning was the Word" paralleling "In the beginning God"
- Exodus echoes: "Before Abraham was, I am" - the burning bush name
- Numbers echoes: Bronze serpent lifted up prophecy of crucifixion
- Wilderness echoes: Manna in desert vs. true bread from heaven
- Temple echoes: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up"
- Previous prayers: Through Prayer 40's resurrection witness, now seeing pre-incarnate Word

CONCLUSION:
- Mechanically carries 1-40: YES
- Holographically carries 1-40: YES
- Ready for Prayer 42: YES
